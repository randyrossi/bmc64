# Build Instructions

These instructions have been tested on Debian/Ubuntu/Mint distributions. If you are using a different platform or distribution, adjust accordingly. For example, changing *apt* to *yum* on CentOS.

----
## Prerequisites
1. If your system doesn't already have them, install all of the regular build tools:

        sudo apt-get install git build-essential automake autoconf libtool pkg-config autoconf-archive autotools-dev bison flex

2. Install the 65xx cross assembler:

        sudo apt-get install xa65


----
## Downloading The Required Files

1. Clone the repo. Note the bmc64 directory will be created automatically in the folder you are in:
   
        cd /path/to/store/files/
           
        git clone https://github.com/randyrossi/bmc64.git --recursive

3. Download and unpack the *GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm*:

    * Visit [https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads)
    * Download the package for your system. For example, at the time of writing [gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-x86\_64-linux.tar.bz2](https://developer.arm.com/-/media/Files/downloads/gnu-rm/9-2019q4/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2) was available for Linux x86\_64.
    * Once downloaded, extract the file somewhere. Note down the path to the extracted directory. This will be used later.
    * In the extracted directory, find the /lib/gcc/arm-none-eabi/ directory and note down the version number. This will be used later.
    * UPDATE - recent attempts only the 2019-q4 version seems to work

----
## Building

1. Set the ARM_HOME environment variable to point to the extracted Arm toolchain directory:

   * Note this is the directory just before the first 'bin' directory.  In my case "~/software/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major" 

        export ARM_HOME=/path/to/extracted/toolchain/directory

        e.g. "export ARM_HOME=~/software/gcc-arm-none-eabi-9-2019-q4-major"
     
2. Set the PATH environment variable to point to the Arm toolchain's *bin* directory:

        export PATH=$PATH:$ARM_HOME/bin

3. Set the ARM_VERSION environment variable to the version number you noted previously:

        export ARM_VERSION=9.2.1

4. UPDATE - another PREFIX needs to be set:

        export PREFIX=arm-none-eabi-
   
5. UPDATE - to fix the bug with LEX/FLEX stopping the compile please edit third_party/vice-3.3/configure.proto

        Comment out this (using dnl):

        if test x"$LEX" = "x:"; then
        AC_MSG_ERROR([Could not find either flex or lex!])
        fi

        so that it reads:

        dnl if test x"$LEX" = "x:"; then
        dnl AC_MSG_ERROR([Could not find either flex or lex!])
        dnl fi

        IMPORTANT: Now run this from the same folder (third_party/vice-3.3):
   
           ./autogen.sh
        
6. If this is your first time building, run *clean_all.sh* from the bmc64 directory:

        cd /path/to/store/files/bmc64/
        ./clean_all.sh

7. Run *make_all.sh* from the bmc64 directory to build the third party libraries and kernel:

        cd /path/to/store/files/bmc64/
        ./make_all.sh [pi0|pi2|pi3]

        NOTE: In the above, set the required Pi version, such as ./make_all.sh pi3

        Its worth noting there will be compile warnings / errors - but it should build your kernal image.

8. Run *make_machines.sh* to build the kernel images for each machine (C64, C128, etc):

        cd /path/to/store/files/bmc64/
        ./make_machines.sh [pi0|pi2|pi3]

        NOTE: In the above, set the required Pi version, such as ./make_machines.sh pi3


----
## Output
Once the *make_all.sh* build is complete, you will have a kernel file for the Pi version that you built for:

* *Raspberry Pi Zero*: kernel.img
* *Raspberry Pi 2*: kernel7.img
* *Raspberry Pi 3*: kernel8-32.img

Once the *make_machines.sh* build is complete, you will have kernel files with a suffix (.c64, .c128, .vic20, etc) for the Pi version that you built for. For example, if pi3 was used you might get the following files:

* kernel8-32.img.c128
* kernel8-32.img.c64
* kernel8-32.img.pet
* kernel8-32.img.plus4
* kernel8-32.img.plus4emu
* kernel8-32.img.vic20

## More About The Build Files

* *clean\_all.sh*: Cleans everything
* *make\_all.sh [pi0|pi2|pi3]*: Builds third party libraries (Vice/Circle) and will also build a C64 image for the selected Pi model. This step will likely fail if you don't run *clean\_all.sh* first.
* *make\_machines.sh [pi0|pi2|pi3]*: Builds all machines for the selected Pi model. This step will likely fail if you don't run *make\_all.sh* first.


----
## Problems
1. When you run *make\_all.sh* you get an error such as '#error "<dirent.h> not supported"'

    Ensure you have all of the build tools installed from the prerequisites step.
    
    If it still does not work, try rebooting your machine and following the "Building" steps again.

2. When you run one of the build scripts (*clean\_all.sh*, *make\_all.sh* or *make\_machines.sh*), you get an error such as 'arm-eabi-g++: Command not found'

    Before you build, set the PREFIX environment variable so arm-none-eabi-g++ is used instead since the *GNU Embedded Toolchain for Arm* download seems to only have the commands with "none" in the filenames. For example: export PREFIX=arm-none-eabi-

3. I have a different build issue...

    * Ensure you have set all environment variables in the "Building" step. For example, if you forget to set the ARM\_HOME and ARM\_VERSION variables, *make\_all.sh* will default to "$HOME/gcc-arm-none-eabi-7-2018-q2-update" with a version of "7.3.1" which may or may not exist on your system.
    * Ensure you have all prerequisites installed.
    * Ensure you follow each step above.
    * Ensure you run the build scripts in the following order: *clean\_all.sh*, *make\_all.sh*, *make\_machines.sh*

## Dependencies

These are the git hashes for the repos under circle-stdlib this project is known to work with. If the patches don't apply successfully, it's possible those projects have moved forward causing incompatibilities. If that happens, reset these repos using "git reset HASH --hard" commands in the following directories:

* circle-stdlib: dda16112cdb5470240cd51fb33bf72b311634340
* libs/circle: fe24b6bebd1532f2a0ee981af12eaf50cc9e97fb
