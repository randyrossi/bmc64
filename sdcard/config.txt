# uncomment scaling_kernel and set the desired value if you want to
# change the scaling that affects the overall sharpness of the picture.
# 8 = NEAREST NEIGHBOUR - sharp edges
# 2 = SINC_BLACKMAN - good looking compromise
# 6 = HAMMING - soft edges (default)
#scaling_kernel=2

# NOTE: Since v3.0, the video settings here and the
# accompanying cmdline.txt settings are configured by
# machines.txt. See README.md for how to switch
# machine configs.

# uncomment if you get no picture on HDMI for a default "safe" mode
#hdmi_safe=1

# uncomment to force a HDMI mode rather than DVI. This can make audio work in
# DMT (computer monitor) modes
#hdmi_drive=2

# uncomment to increase signal to HDMI, if you have interference, blanking, or
# no display
#config_hdmi_boost=4

# Some demos/games will simply not perform well at the
# default 700mhz clock rate. This will be evident as
# the audio/video stutters under heavy load. These 
# settings will improve performance in the majority
# of cases, but there will still be some situations
# where the emulator will struggle. If you are not
# comfortable with overclocking your Pi, consider
# using bmc64 on Pi2 or Pi3. These are considered
# fairly safe settings but I take no responsibility
# for any damage caused to your device by using them.
# Please see the documentation at the github site
# for more info.

# IMPORTANT: A kernel= parameter will appear here after
# a machine switch to a kernel other than C64. This kernel
# will be Pi model specific so the SDCard will no longer
# boot on a model other than the one the switch took
# place on . If you want to make the card bootable from any
# Pi model again, simply switch back to C64.
