    (12o), and decimal (10l) format
  * new "step" buttons for stepping to the 16-bit address at the top of
    the stack ('Return') or any 16-bit address specified by the user
    ('Step to')
  * the debugger prints more detailed information about syntax and
    runtime errors in Lua scripts, and there is a new button to insert
    an empty breakpoint callback function

  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 1.2.9.2
--------------------------

  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 1.2.9.1
--------------------------

  * some improvements and optimizations in the p4fliconv and compress
    utilities
  * a few minor bugs have been fixed

Changes in version 1.2.9
------------------------

  * added a C interface that allows using the emulator as a shared
    library in other programs; the library and header file can be found
    in the 'plus4lib' subdirectory of the binary packages, and a simple
    example program with compile instructions is also included
  * implemented IEC level MPS-801 printer emulation, in addition to the
    previously existing hardware level MPS-802 emulation
  * added a new button to the debugger GUI that makes it possible to
    break only when a branch is taken (i.e. the opposite of 'Step over')
  * more accurate PAL emulation in OpenGL mode when the display quality
    is set to 3
  * LED display is now also implemented for IEC level drive emulation
  * the ROM images required by the emulator are included with the binary
    packages, and no longer need to be downloaded separately
  * fixed a bug in the 'Step over' function of the debugger
  * fixed/improved support for D64 error information; this allows some
    copy protected games that previously did not work to load correctly
  * the 'compress' utility has two new compression methods, some new
    options, and the original method is 3-5 times faster now while
    producing identical files; also, compression support in 'p4fliconv'
    is improved somewhat
  * various minor bug fixes, optimizations, and other improvements

Changes in version 1.2.8.1
--------------------------

  * fixed file overwrite (@) bug in IEC level drive emulation

Changes in version 1.2.8
------------------------

  * new option for saving the printer output to a text file, either as
    the raw characters sent to the printer, or converted to ASCII
  * slightly improved compression when saving the printer output in TGA
    format
  * added Windows icons from the Plus/4 icon set by SVS
  * when using the mouse to set the cursor position, the color of the
    character under the cursor is now saved, set, and restored correctly
  * minor utility and Windows installer improvements and fixes
  * some optimizations in software video mode, and serial floppy drive
    and printer emulation

Changes in version 1.2.7
------------------------

  * added support for using the mouse to change the cursor position in
    the emulated machine, and copying text to and pasting from the
    clipboard; the following functions are available:
      left click: sets the cursor position
      right click: sets the cursor position, and copies the selected
        word to the clipboard
      ctrl + right click: sets the cursor position, and copies text from
        the selected line to the clipboard
      shift + right click: copies text from the whole screen to the
        clipboard without changing the cursor position
      middle click: sets the cursor position, and pastes text from the
        clipboard
      shift + middle click: pastes text from the clipboard without
        changing the cursor position
    Note that these are disabled when a display mode that hides the menu
    bar and the mouse cursor is selected, or light pen emulation - which
    also uses the mouse - is enabled.
  * new command line option (-keybuf) for typing text of any length at
    startup; the text can also be read from a file
  * added machine configuration option to control the SID output volume;
    this also affects the sound recorded to AVI files
  * increased TED audio output level relative to the default SID output
    level, for better accuracy in programs that use both types of sound
    at the same time
  * minor sound emulation fixes
  * the process priority of the emulator can be changed from the GUI
    (currently, this is only implemented on Windows)
  * some utility improvements: 'compress' has more options now, and is
    optimized somewhat for slightly better efficiency and speed;
    'p4fliconv' automatically detects the use of the C64 palette in GIF
    files and enables pixel exact reading mode, and there is a new
    experimental hires conversion algorithm as well
  * minor optimizations
  * in OpenGL video mode, the vertical interlace effect is now also
    displayed at quality 1 and 2, and quality 2 uses 32-bit textures for
    improved color accuracy at the expense of being somewhat slower
    (previously, both interlace and 32-bit textures were enabled only at
    quality 3)
  * fixed bug that prevented the emulator display from being correctly
    redrawn when damaged on Windows in software video mode or OpenGL
    with the quality set to 0
  * a few Linux compile and link errors have been fixed

Changes in version 1.2.6.1
--------------------------

  * fixed bug in changing the type of a floppy drive with no image file
    selected
  * fixed link errors when building from source code on Linux

Changes in version 1.2.6
------------------------

  * implemented IEC level floppy drive emulation; this allows access to
    a directory on the PC filesystem, and supports reading and writing
    .prg, .p00, .s00, .u00, and .r00 files, and some commonly used CBM
    DOS commands
  * the debugger window now displays the current state of TED registers
  * on Windows and MacOS X the native file selection dialog is used
    instead of the FLTK one; also, the last PRG and screenshot file
    selected is remembered by the dialogs
  * various improvements have been made to the utilities
  * changed the TED luminance table to (hopefully) match the colors of
    the real machine more accurately
  * when recording video to AVI files in RLE8 format, some TV emulation
    color effects are now also captured using additional palette colors
  * D64 files with any number of tracks from 35 to 42 are supported
  * new/improved GUI keyboard shortcuts
  * the old file I/O hack has been removed, since its functionality is
    now replaced by the IEC level drive emulation
  * added Gtk+ GUI theme (enabled with '-colorscheme 3' command line
    option)
  * some minor bugs have been fixed

Changes in version 1.2.5.2
--------------------------

  * fixed some minor TED emulation bugs

Changes in version 1.2.5.1
--------------------------

  * the full speed mode (Alt+W) now restores the original speed setting
    when turned off
  * added a "go to program counter" button to the disassembler in the
    debugger
  * some new utilities have been added
  * a few minor bugs have been fixed

Changes in version 1.2.5
------------------------

  * implemented Lua scripting in the debugger; this makes it possible to
    write complex rules for breakpoints, but can have other uses as
    well, since the script can read and write memory and CPU registers,
    in addition to having access to the standard Lua library functions
  * changed the debugger window layout so that there is a larger window
    with only two tabs
  * the disassembly view in the debugger now allows for paging backward,
    and the disassembly and memory dump displays can also be scrolled
    with the mouse wheel
  * made the serial bus delay for the 1541 high timing accuracy mode
    adjustable; while the default setting works with all the disk turbos
    tested so far, this option may be useful for debugging purposes
  * when using audio files as tape images, the signal read or written
    can optionally be inverted for compatibility with other software
  * the enabling of 6551 ACIA emulation is now configurable, rather than
    being fixed to machine configurations with 64K or more RAM
  * SID emulation and floppy drives with no disk image attached can be
    disabled from the GUI menu to reduce CPU usage; previously, these
    automatically enabled features could only be turned off by a forced
    or hard reset
  * added new GUI menu items for resetting floppy drives
  * new command line option (-tape) for loading tape images on startup;
    it has also been made possible to automatically load a file with
    .prg, .p00, .d64, .d81, or .tap extension by using the file name as
    a single command line argument
  * minor bug fixes and optimizations

Changes in version 1.2.4
------------------------

  * implemented the 6551 ACIA registers at $FD00-$FD0F, which are
    automatically enabled for configurations with 64K or more RAM; this
    is not complete yet, but the basic functionality works
  * video recording can also be done in RLE8 format now, which allows
    smaller file sizes than uncompressed YV12, at the expense of some TV
    emulation effects not being captured
  * added new command line option for selecting the GUI style and colors
  * various minor improvements and bug fixes

Changes in version 1.2.3
------------------------

  * video and sound output can be recorded to AVI files
  * more accurate colors in NTSC mode
  * TED sound emulation improvements
  * added hue shift to the display configuration options
  * minor optimizations in serial floppy drive and printer emulation
  * the drive head position is now also shown on the LED display when
    it is changing
  * a few bug fixes

Changes in version 1.2.2
------------------------

  * implemented Digi-Blaster emulation
  * added limited support for error information in D64 files
  * new option for setting SID model (6581 or 8580) to be emulated
  * P00 format files can be loaded
  * emulation speed percentage is now displayed on the title bar; it is
    also possible to set half, double, etc. speed in the menu
  * the head position (track, side, and sector) of all floppy drives
    can be displayed in a window

Changes in version 1.2.1
------------------------

  * TED emulation improvements; also fixed a bug introduced in version
    1.1.1
  * the frame rate in full speed mode is now limited to a maximum of
    50 Hz to improve performance
  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 1.2.0
------------------------

  * many improvements in the TV emulation; to enable all the new
    features, use OpenGL mode and set the display quality to 3 (requires
    OpenGL 2.0 or newer and shader support)
  * added a tedmon-like monitor to the debugger; it supports all the
    commands, including assemble, but there are also some improvements
    and additional features (use ? to print the list of commands, or ? N
    for help on command N)
  * it is now possible to set breakpoints on TED video positions in the
    debugger
  * trace command in the monitor for logging CPU instructions to a text
    file; when debugging the main CPU, the TED video position at the
    first cycle of each opcode is also logged
  * light pen emulation
  * hardware level 1526/MPS-802 printer emulation
  * the file I/O ROM module now also includes a tape turbo; to enable
    it, set $0647 to $17, $27, $37, or $47 to select speed (from slowest
    to fastest), and use device 7 when saving
  * tape playback and recording can be sent to the sound output
  * the RAM startup pattern has been made configurable
  * minor TED emulation improvements
  * various bug fixes

Changes in version 1.1.3
------------------------

  * fixed bug in Hannes memory expansion emulation
  * improved 6523 emulation in 1551 floppy drives
  * minor bug fixes

Changes in version 1.1.2
------------------------

  * fixed bug that caused the tape input signal to get stuck at high
    level sometimes even after stopping or closing the tape
  * optimized 1541 high timing accuracy mode
  * adjusted reSID filter for different clock frequency in Plus/4

Changes in version 1.1.1
------------------------

  * added new 1541 timing code that fixes some programs that previously
    did not load, at the expense of higher CPU usage; it is enabled by
    default, and can be turned on/off in the floppy configuration dialog
  * more accurate emulation of television vertical synchronization
  * MacOS X build fixes; also added patch for FLTK 1.1.7 which fixes the
    check callback on OS X
  * improvements and fixes in TED video shift register emulation
  * fixed CPU I/O port data direction register ($0000)
  * the ROM package now includes the 1541 DOS, rather than the 1541-II,
    as the latter breaks some demos; the 1541-II can still be used by
    loading dos15412.rom to ROM segment 10 in the machine configuration
  * minor optimizations

Changes in version 1.1.0
------------------------

  * implemented 1551 drive emulation
  * added floppy drive LED display to the GUI (1541 is red, 1551 is
    green, and 1581 is yellow)
  * the debugger now allows for debugging floppy drives; the drives are
    also mapped to the physical address range $180000-$1BFFFF
  * fixed 1541 disk change detection
  * keyboard map can be configured with the GUI
  * external game devices like joysticks and gamepads are supported, and
    can be assigned in the keyboard map like normal keys
  * the 'step over' button in the debugger now also skips branch
    instructions
  * invalid opcodes that normally jam the CPU can be used as breakpoints
    (with the priority assumed to be 3) that open the debugger, and the
    execution of the program can continue as if there was a NOP
    instruction
  * added new command line options for loading disk image, snapshot, and
    demo files on start-up; on Windows, D64 and D81 files are also
    optionally associated with the emulator
  * it is now possible to use WAV, AIFF, and other sound file formats as
    tape images; these files can be read and written, however, new files
    are created in plus4emu format
  * blank video output is generated when the TED is disabled by setting
    bit 5 of $FF07
  * reduced horizontal texture resolution to 384 in OpenGL mode when the
    quality is set to 0, for improved performance
  * minor GUI improvements and fixes
