Compiling VICE on Win32 with Cygwin
===================================

1. Install Cygwin [http://cygwin.com/].  Download and run the setup.exe
   tool.  During installation, be sure to select these two packages (along
   with all the ones selected by default):

        gcc: C compiler upgrade helper               (I used 3.4.4-3)
        make: The GNU version of the 'make' utility  (I used 3.81-1)

   These are both found under the Devel category.  'gcc' will bring in
   the packages gcc-core, gcc-c++, gcc-mingw-core, and gcc-mingw-g++ as
   dependencies.

2. Obtain a copy of the VICE sources.  Extract the vice-x.xx directory into
   your Cygwin user's home directory (e.g. /home/Owner/vice-2.0).

3. Obtain DirectX 7 header files and libraries.  It doesn't look like
   Microsoft still makes this distribution available for download from its
   website, but if you search the web for "dx7libhdr.exe" you should still
   be able to find it.  Alternatively, (I haven't tried this myself, but in
   theory) you should be able to use the latest DirectX headers available
   from Microsoft.  Note, however, that distributions of DirectX later than
   version 7 contain a large amount of stuff (about a half of a gigabyte
   worth) that you won't need if all you want to do is just build VICE.

   dx7libhdr.exe is a self-extracting achive.  Extract the dx7sdk directory
   from it into your Cygwin user's home directory (e.g. /home/Owner/dx7sdk).

4. Change into the VICE sources directory.

   If you have checked out the unstable svn version of VICE you need to generate
   the configure script first by doing:

     ./autogen.sh

    The stable tarball already has the configure script, so continue with:

     CFLAGS="-mno-cygwin -I$HOME/dx7sdk/include" ./configure --without-png --without-zlib

   Note that you must specify "-mno-cygwin" to get the mingw compiler;
   otherwise the build will try to use Cygwin's default gcc compiler, which
   will choke on symbols like FAR that are used (but not defined) in the
   DirectX headers.

   Wait for configure to finish.  Then run

     make

   to build the binaries, and

     make bindist

   to make an executable distribution, which will appear in a directory
   called e.g. /home/Owner/vice-2.0/src/WinVICE-2.0.  For development
   purposes, no further installation is necessary; you can run the
   executables directly from this directory.

   I haven't been able to build VICE with PNG and ZLIB support under Cygwin
   yet, but it is probably not too difficult.

   Note: configuring and building VICE under Cygwin can take a *long* time
   to finish, even on a fast computer.  Be prepared to be patient.
