 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 This release stabilizes and introduces the GTK3 UI as the primary user 
 interface for all major ports. For "lesser" platforms we still have the SDL 
 based interface. All other user interfaces have been removed. RIP

 We are still looking for dedicated maintainers for the Windows- and macOS 
 ports, if you want to help improving these and/or want to provide binaries, 
 please get in touch.
