Copyright @copyright{} 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

@unnumberedsec Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software---to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

@iftex
@unnumberedsec TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end iftex
@ifinfo
@center TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
@end ifinfo

@enumerate 0
@item
This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ``Program'', below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ``work based on the Program''
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ``modification''.)  Each licensee is addressed as ``you''.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

@item
You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

@item
You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

@enumerate a
@item
You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

@item
You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
parties under the terms of this License.

@item
If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
@end enumerate

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

@item
You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

@enumerate a
@item
Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
customarily used for software interchange; or,

@item
Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such
an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
@end enumerate

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

@item
You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

@item
You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

@item
Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.

@item
If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

@item
If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.

@item
The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ``any
later version'', you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.

@item
If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ``AS IS'' WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR

INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING

@unnumberedsec How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ``copyright'' line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

@smallexample
@var{one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.}
Copyright (C) 19@var{yy}  @var{name of author}

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.
@end smallexample

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

@smallexample
Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19@var{yy} @var{name of author}
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.
@end smallexample

The hypothetical commands @samp{show w} and @samp{show c} should show
the appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than @samp{show w} and
@samp{show c}; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items---whatever
suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ``copyright disclaimer'' for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

@example
@group
Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

@var{signature of Ty Coon}, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice
@end group
@end example

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.

@chapter About VICE

VICE is the one and only @dfn{Versatile Commodore Emulator}.  It provides
emulation of the Commodore C64, C64DTV, C128, VIC20, PET, PLUS4, SCPU64 and CBM-II computers
within a single package.  The emulators run as separate programs, but have
the same user interface, share the same settings and support the same
file formats.

@strong{Important notice:} If you have no idea what a Commodore
8-bit computer is, or have questions about how these machines are used,
how the file formats work or anything else that is not strictly
related to VICE, you should read the appropriate FAQs @emph{first}, as
that kind of information is not available here.  @xref{Contacts}. for
information about how to retrieve the FAQs.

All the emulators provide an accurate 6502/6510 emulator, with emulation
of all the opcodes (both documented and undocumented ones) and accurate
timing.  Unlike other emulators, VICE aims to be cycle
accurate; it tries to emulate chip timings as precisely as possible and
does so @emph{efficiently}.

Please do @emph{not} expect the C64DTV, C128, PET, PLUS4, SCPU64 and CBM-II emulators to
be as good as the C64 or VIC20 one, as they are still under construction.

@emph{Notice:} This documentation is written for the Unix release of VICE, but is slowly being made universal.

@section C64 emulator features

As of version 2.3, two C64 emulators are provided: @samp{x64} (fast)
and @samp{x64sc} (accurate).

The fast C64 emulator, called @samp{x64}, features a fairly complete
emulation of the VIC-II video chip: sprites, all registers and all video
modes are fully emulated.  The emulation has been fully cycle-accurate
since version 0.13.0.

The accurate C64 emulator, called @samp{x64sc}, features a cycle-based
and pixel-accurate VIC-II emulation. This requires a much faster machine
than the old @samp{x64}.

A rather complete emulation of the SID sound chip is also provided.  All
the basic features are implemented as well as most of the complex ones
including synchronisation, ring modulation and filters.  There are two
emulators of the SID chip available: first is the ``standard'' VICE
emulator, available since VICE 0.12; the second is Dag Lem's reSID
engine. The reSID engine is a lot more accurate than the standard engine,
but it is also a lot slower, and only suitable for faster machines.

Naturally, also both CIAs (or VIAs, in some cases) are fully emulated
and cycle accurate.


@node C64DTV emulator features, C128 emulator features, C64 emulator features, Preface
@section C64DTV emulator features

The C64DTV emulator, called @samp{x64dtv}, features emulation of C64DTV
revisions 2 and 3. The emulator is under construction, but most of the
DTV specific features are already supported (with varying accuracy).

Video cache is disabled by default as it currently doesn't work with
some of C64DTV's new video modes. The new video modes have a simple
"fake" video cache implementation that may give incorrect results
and decreased performance.


@node C128 emulator features, VIC20 emulator features, C64DTV emulator features, Preface
@section C128 emulator features

The C128 emulator, called @samp{x128}, features a complete emulation of
the internal MMU (@dfn{Memory Management Unit}), 80 column VDC screen, fast
IEC bus emulation, 2 MHz mode, Z80 emulation plus all the features of the
C64 emulation.


@node VIC20 emulator features, PET emulator features, C128 emulator features, Preface
@section VIC20 emulator features

The VIC20 emulates all the internal hardware, including the VIA chips.
The VIC-I video chip is fully emulated except NTSC interlace mode, so most
graphical effects will work correctly.

Sound support is implemented, but is still at an experimental stage.  If
you think it could be improved and know how to do so, feel
free to contact us (@pxref{Contacts}).

The VIC20 emulator now allows the use of the VIC1112 IEEE488
interface. You have to enable the hardware (by menu, resource, or
commandline option) and then load the IEEE488 ROM (see for
example @uref{http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/schematics/cartridges/vic20/ieee-488/325329-04.bin}, but you have to double the size to 4k for now).
The IEEE-488 code is then started by @code{SYS45065}.

@section PET emulator features

The PET emulator emulates the 2001, 3032, 4032, 8032, 8096, 8296 and
SuperPET (MicroMainFrame 9000) models, covering the whole series.
The hardware is pretty much the same in each and that is why one single
program is enough to emulate all of them.  For more detailed information
about PET hardware please refer to the @file{PETdoc} file.
@c FIXME: add link to PETdoc.txt

Both the 40 column and 80 column CRTC video chips are emulated (from the
4032 onward), but a few of the features are not implemented yet (numbers
of rasterlines per char and lines per screen).  Fortunately, they are
not very important for average applications.

Sound is available for the PET as well, but like the VIC20's it is still
under construction.

The PET 8096 is basically a PET 8032 with a 64k extension board which
allows remapping the upper 32k with RAM.  You have to write to a special
register at @code{$fff0} to remap the memory.  The PET 8296 is a
8096 but with a completely redesigned motherboard with 128k RAM in
total.  Of the additional 32k RAM you can use only some in blocks of 4k,
but you have to set jumpers on the motherboard for it.  VICE uses the
command line options @samp{-petram9} and @samp{-petramA}
instead.  Also, the video controller can handle a larger address range.
The PET 8x96 model emulations run the Commodore LOS-96 operating system
- basically an improved BASIC 4 version with up to 32k for BASIC
text and 32k for variables.  See @file{PETdoc} for more information.
@c FIXME: add link to PETdoc.txt

The PET 8296D is an 8296 with built-in 8250 low-profile dual disk drive.

The PET 8296GD is an 8296D with additionally a "HiRes Emulator" (HRE).
This is a cheaper version of a "HRG" hi-res board which was based on
Thomson chips. This version instead uses no additional hardware support
apart from some memory mapping tricks. It has supporting software in the
hre-*.bin rom files.

The SuperPET also is a PET 8032 with an expansion board.  It can map 4k
at a time out of 64k into the @code{$9***} area.  Also it has an ACIA
6551 for RS232 communication.  The 6809 CPU that is built into the
SuperPET is now emulated, since release 2.4, including the 6702 dongle
chip.

The Super-OS-9 MMU expansion, developed by TPUG (Toronto PET Users
Group) is also emulated.

The PET computers came with three major ROM revisions, so-called BASIC
1, 2 and 4, all of which are provided.  The PET 2001 uses the version 1,
the PET 3032 uses version 2, and the others use version 4.  The 2001 ROM
is horribly broken with respect to IEEE488 (they shipped it before they
tested it with the floppy drive, so only tape worked.  Therefore the
emulator patches the ROM to fix the IEEE488 routines.

As well as other low-level fixes the 2001 patch obtains the load address
for a program file from the first two bytes of the file.  This allows
the loading of both PET2001-saved files (that have $0400 as their load
address) and other PET files (that have $0401).  The PET2001 saves from
$0400 and not from $0401 as other PETs do.

Moreover, the secondary addresses used are now @code{0} and @code{1} for
load and save, respectively, and not arbitrary unused secondary
addresses.

To select which model to run, specify it on the
command line with the @code{-model MODEL} option, where
@code{MODEL} can be one of a list of PET model numbers, all
described in @pxref{PET model}

@node CBM-II emulator features, SCPU64 emulator features, PET emulator features, Preface
@section CBM-II emulator features

The CBM-II emulator emulates several types of CBM-II models.  Those
models are known under different names in the USA and Europe.  In the
States they have been sold as @code{B128} and @code{B256}, in Europe as
@code{CBM 610}, @code{CBM 620} (low-profile case) or @code{CBM 710} and
@code{CBM 720} (high-profile case with monitor). In addition to that
now an experimental C510 emulation is included. The C510 (also known as
P500) is the little brother of the C600/700 machines. It runs at roughly
1 MHz and, surprise, it has a VIC-II instead of the CRTC. Otherwise
the different line of computers are very similar.

These computers are prepared to take a coprocessor board with an 8088 or
Z80 CPU.  Indeed there are models @code{CBM 630} and @code{CBM 730} that
supposedly had those processors.  However these models are not emulated.

The basic difference is the amount of RAM these machines have been
supplied with.  The @code{B128} and the @code{CBM *10} models had 128k
RAM, the others 256k. This implies some banking scheme, as the 6502 can
only address 64k.  And indeed those machines use a 6509, that can
address 1 MByte of RAM.  It has 2 registers at addresses 0 and 1.  The
indirect bank register at address 1 determines the bank (0-15) where the
opcodes @code{LDA (zp),Y} and @code{STA (zp),Y} take the data from.  The
exec bank register at address 0 determines the bank where all other read
and write addresses take place.

The business line machines (C6xx/7xx) have the RAM in banks 1-2, resp.
1-4. All available banks are used for BASIC, where program code is separated
from all variables, resp. from normal variables, strings and arrays that
are distributed over other banks. The C510 instead has RAM in banks 0 and 1,
and uses bank 1 for program and all variables. Bank 0, though, can be
accessed by the VIC-II to display graphics.

Many models have been expanded to more than the built-in memory.  In fact
some machines have been expanded to the full 1M.  Bank 15 is used as
system bank, with only little RAM, and lots of expansion cartridge ROM
area, the I/O and the kernal/basic ROMs.  Some models have been modified
to map RAM into the expansion ROM area.  Those modifications can be
emulated as well.

The different settings are described in @pxref{CBM-II model}.

@node SCPU64 emulator features, Keyboard emulation, CBM-II emulator features, Preface
@section SCPU64 emulator features

The XSCPU64 emulator is a simulation of a C64 equipped with a SuperCPU64 V2B. Features:

@itemize @bullet
@item 20 MHz asynchronous single cycle 65816 CPU core with proper dummy and invalid cycle handling.
@item 128 KiB static RAM, 0-16 MiB SIMM RAM, 64-512 KiB EPROM emulated and their respective timing details.
@item All RAM optimization configurations supported with write buffer.
@item I/O area access delays, write through to SRAM implemented.
@item Memory mappings including cartridge and boot memory map and kernal shadow.
@item Hardware registers and switches implemented.
@item Replacement SCPU64 ROM compatible with the original to avoid distribution problems
@item It's using the single cycle VICII core for accurate simulation
@end itemize

Still to do:

@itemize @bullet
@item Measure and verify VICII interrupt phase shift
@item Measure and verify BA phase shift
@item SIMM RAM extra 7.5 cycle refresh delay every 10us missing.
@item CPU NMI support for ``reset'' button
@end itemize

The emulation is quite accurate but not perfect. If you code something timing
intensive using this simulation please always check it on real hardware to avoid
bad surprises.

The hardware itself is asynchronous in nature, therefore caution must be taken
to not do long timing loops without synchronization in 20 MHz mode. Also don't
squeeze out the last remaining cycles without leaving a safety buffer.
Synchronization points can be created by doing I/O reads or writes and leaving
a few hundred cycles left each frame will not hurt.

Otherwise it can happen that the code is running on this version of VICE or my
SCPU64 V2+C128D perfectly but nowhere else due to manufacturing variations and
frequency drifts.

@node Keyboard emulation, Joystick emulation, SCPU64 emulator features, Preface
@section The keyboard emulation

There are two ways of emulating the keyboard in VICE.

The default way (@dfn{symbolic mapping}) is to map every key
combination to the corresponding key combination on the real machine:
for example, if you press @key{*}, which is bound to @kbd{Shift-8} on a
U.S. keyboard, in the C64 emulator, the emulated machine will have just
the @emph{unshifted} @key{*} key pressed (as @key{*} is unshifted on the
C64 keyboard).  Likewise, pressing @key{'} on the same U.S. keyboard
without any shift key will cause the combination @kbd{Shift-7} to be
pressed in the emulated C64.  This way, it becomes quite obvious what
keys should be typed to obtain all the symbols.

There is, however, one problem with symbolic mapping: some keys really
need to be mapped specially regardless.  The most important examples
being, in the VIC20, C64 and C128 emulators, that @key{CTRL} is mapped
to @key{Tab} and that the @key{Commodore} key is mapped to the left
@key{Control}). The @key{RUN/STOP} key is mapped to the @key{ESC} key
on the PC keyboard. The PET emulator, lacking the @key{Commodore} key
but having an @key{ESC} key, uses the left @key{Control} key as
@key{RUN/STOP} and the @key{ESC} key as @key{ESC} of course.

@c FIXME: add a detailed list of all keys

The second way (@dfn{positional mapping}) is to map every key on the
``real'' keyboard to the key which has the same position on the keyboard
of the emulated machine.  This way, no @key{Shift} key is forced by the
program (with the exception of the function keys @key{F2}, @key{F4},
@key{F6} and @key{F8}, which require @key{Shift} on the Commodore
keyboards), and the keyboard is more comfortable to use in those
programs (such as some games) that require the keys to be in the correct
positions.

@strong{Warning:} unlike the real C64, VICE ``presses'' the @key{Shift}
key @emph{together} with the key to shift when the @key{Shift} must be
forced.  In most cases this should work fine, but some keyboard routines
are quite picky and tend not to recognize the shift key because of this.
For instance, @kbd{F6} (which on the real C64 is obtained with
@kbd{Shift + F5}) could be recognized as @kbd{F5}.  In that case, use
the shift key manually (i.e., type @kbd{Shift + F5} in the example).
Yes, we know this is a bug.

The @kbd{RESTORE} key is mapped to @kbd{Page Up} (or @kbd{Prev}) by
default.


@node Joystick emulation, Disk drive emulation, Keyboard emulation, Preface
@section The joystick emulation

Joysticks can be emulated both via the keyboard and via a real joystick
connected to the host machine (the latter only works on GNU/Linux
systems).

There are two keyboard layouts for joystick use, known as @dfn{numpad}
and @dfn{custom}.

The @dfn{numpad} layout uses the numeric keypad keys, i.e., the numbers
@key{1}@dots{}@key{9} which emulate all the directions including the
diagonal ones; @key{0} emulates the fire button.

The @dfn{custom} layout uses the keys @key{w}, @key{e}, @key{r},
@key{s}, @key{d}, @key{f}, @key{x}, @key{c}, @key{v} for the directions
and @key{space} for the fire button instead.


@node Disk drive emulation, Supported file formats, Joystick emulation, Preface
@section The disk drive emulation

All the emulators support up to 4 external disk drives as
devices 8, 9, 10 and 11.  Each of these devices can emulate virtual
Commodore 1541, 1541-II, 1571, 1581, 2031, 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and
8250 drives in one of four ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
using disk images, i.e., files that contain a dump of all the blocks
contained in a real floppy disk (if you want more information about
what a disk image is, consult the
@code{comp.emulators.cbm} FAQ);
@item
accessing file system directories, thus giving you the use of files
without having to copy them to disk images; this also allows you to
read and write files in the @code{P00} format (again, consult the
@code{comp.emulators.cbm} FAQ for more info).
@item
accessing a real device connected to the host machine. As of VICE 1.11
it is possible to connect real drives like Commodore 1541 to the
printer port of the host using the XA1541 or XM1541 cable. Currently
this only works on Linux or Windows using the OpenCBM library. You can
get it from @uref{http://www.lb.shuttle.de/puffin/cbm4linux} (cbm4linux,
Linux version) or from @uref{http://cbm4win.sf.net} (cbm4win, Windows
version).

@item
directly using the disk drive of the host. The 3.5" disk drive of the
host can be used to read or write Commodore 1581 formatted disks.
Currently this raw drive access feature is only available for Linux
hosts.
@end itemize

When using disk images there are two available types of drive
emulation.  One of them the @dfn{virtual drive} emulation.  It does
@emph{not} really emulate the serial line, but patches the kernal ROM
(with the so-called @dfn{kernal traps}) so that serial line operations
can be emulated via C language routines.  This emulation is very fast,
but only allows use of standard DOS functions (and not even all of
them).  For real device or raw drive access it is required to enable
this type of emulation.

The IEEE488 drives (2031, 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 8250) do
not use kernal traps. Instead the IEEE488 interface lines are
monitored and the data is passed to the drive emulation. To use them
on the C64, you need to enable the IEEE488 interface emulation. Only
if the IEEE488 emulation is enabled, those drives can be selected.

The other alternative is a @dfn{true drive} emulation.  The
Commodore disk drives are provided with their own CPU (a 6502 as the
VIC20 and the PETs) and their own RAM and ROM.  So, in order to more
closely emulate its features, a complete emulation of this hardware
must be provided and that is what the @dfn{hardware level} emulation
does. When the @dfn{hardware level} emulation is used, the kernal
routines remain unpatched and the serial line is fully emulated.
The problem with this emulation is that it needs a lot of processing
power, mainly because the emulator has to emulate two CPUs instead of
one.

The PETs do not use a serial IEC bus to communicate with the floppy
drive but instead use the parallel IEEE488 bus.  This does
@emph{byte by byte} transfers, as opposed to the @emph{bit by bit}
transfers of the C64 and VIC20, so making it feasible to emulate the
parallel line completely while emulating the drive at DOS level only.
The IEEE488 line interpreter maps the drives 8-11 (as described
above) to the IEEE488 disk units, and no kernal traps are needed.
The same emulation of the Commodore IEEE488 bus interface is
available for the C64 and the VIC20. With IEEE488 drives you can have
true 2031 emulation at unit #8, and still have filesystem access at
units #10 or #11, because monitoring the IEEE488 lines does not
interfere with the true drive emulation.

The IEEE488 disk drives 2040, 3040, 4040, 8050 and 8250 are Dual Drive
Floppy Disks.  This means that these drives handle two disks. To
accomplish the emulation, only two disks can be emulated, namely units
#8 and #10. The attached image, track display and LED display of unit
#9 and #11 are used for the second drive of the dual disk drives. On
unix the unit number display (8 or 9, 10 or 11) in the emulation
window changes to the drive number display (0 or 1).

The Commodore 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 8250 disk drives are
so-called "old-style" disk drives. Their architecture includes not
one, but two processors of the 6502 type, namely a 6502 for the file
handling and communication with the PET (IP), and a 6504 (which is a
6502 with reduced address space) for the drive handling (FDC). Both
processors communicate over a shared memory area. The IP writes
commands to read/write blocks to this area and the FDC executes them.
To make the emulation feasible, the FDC processor is not emulated
cycle-exactly as a 6504, but simply by checking the commands and
executing them on the host. This provides a fast FDC emulation, but
disallows the sending the FDC processor commands to execute code.
Applications where this is necessary are believed to be rather
seldom. Only the format command uses this feature, but this is
checked for.

The dual disk drive 2040 emulates one of the very first CBM disk
drives. This drive has DOS version 1. DOS1 uses an own disk type,
that is closely related to the 1541 disk image. Only on tracks 18-24
DOS1 disks have a sector more than 1541 disks. DOS1 disk images have
the extension .d67.

The dual disk drives 3040 and 4040 use the same logical disk format
as the VC1541 and the 2031. In fact, the 4040 was the first disk with
DOS version 2. The 3040 emulated here originally was the same as
2040, only for the european 30xx PET series. As many of the original
DOS1 disk drives were upgraded (a simple ROM upgrade!) to DOS2, I use
the 3040 number for a DOS 2.0 disk drive, and 4040 for a revised DOS
2 disk drive. It is, however, not yet clear whether the disks here
are write compatible to the 1541, as rumors exist that the write gap
between  sectors is different. But read compatible they are. As VICE
emulates the FDC processor in C and not as 6504 emulation, this does
not matter in VICE.

The drives 1001, 8050 and 8250 do actually have the very same DOS
ROM. Only the code in the FDC is different, which is taken care of by
VICE. So for all three of those disk drives, only @code{dos1001} is
needed. The DOS version used is 2.7.

and how to resolve them.

@node Sound problems, Video problems, Common problems, Common problems
@subsection Sound problems

VICE should compile and run without major problems on many systems,
but there are some known issues related to the sound driver.

If you are having sound problems, such as skipping, first monitor how much CPU
time the respective emulator is taking on your system. To run smoothly, on a
modern system, it should really never go over 50% or so, except for very short
peaks that should also stay well beyond 90%. If you see it takes more, try
disabling some of the most CPU intense features (disable CRT emulation, use
fastsid instead of reSID, disable true drive emulation).

If the CPU usage is ok, try using a different sound driver. You may also try
increasing the sound buffer size (although the default should be ok for modern
systems).

Linux, AIX and SGI systems should play sound without any problems; if
you are running Linux please use a 2.x kernel, as VICE needs some
features that were not implemented in older versions of the Linux sound
driver.

Windows should play sound ok.

macOS is currently untested.

All platforms that can run the SDL port (like Amiga, BeOS, etc) should be able
to play sound via SDL.

@cindex HP-UX and Solaris audio problems
On the other hand, HP-UX and Solaris machines are known to cause
troubles.  If you think you can help debugging the code for these
systems, your help would be really appreciated.  We are having troubles
finding HP-UX and SUN consoles to work at@dots{}

@cindex OSS/Linux problems
Some problems have been reported with the proprietary version of the
Open Sound System for Linux.  With a Crystal sound card, sound output
was significantly delayed and, apparently, the allocated buffer size was
completely wrong.  This is not a VICE bug, but rather an OSS bug.

@node Video problems, Printer problems , Sound problems, Common problems
@subsection Video problems

Due to the way VICE currently handles its main loop, a common problem with
video sync occurs when the real (the monitors) frame rate is very close to, 
equal, or lower than the framerate of the emulated machine. We recommend to
use a framerate which is slightly higher than that (eg 51Hz for the C64).

@node Printer problems, PET keyboard problems ,Video problems, Common problems
@subsection Printer problems

VICE supports the emulation of a printer either on the userport or as
IEC device 4. Unfortunately the Commodore IEC routines do not
send all commands to the IEC bus. For example an @code{OPEN 1,4}
is not seen on the IEC bus. Also a @code{CLOSE 1} after that
is not seen. VICE can see from printing that there was an @code{OPEN},
but it cannot see when the close was. Also a "finish print job"
cannot be seen on the userport device.
To flush the printer buffer (write to @code{print.dump} or to the
printer) now a menu entry can be used. Disabling and re-enabling the printer
should work as well.

The printing services have not been extensively tested but apart
from the problem mentioned above it should work fine now.

@node PET keyboard problems, ,Printer problems, Common problems
@subsection PET keyboard problems

If you find that the German keyboard mapping (plus German charset)
does not print uppercase umlauts, then you are right.
The umlauts replace the [,\ and ] characters in the charset. The keys
that make these characters do not have a different entry in the
PET editor ROM tables when shifted.
Thus it is not possible to get the uppercase umlauts in the editor.
Nevertheless other programs are reported to change the keyboard
mapping table and thus allow the use of the shifted (uppercase) umlauts.

Anyway, the VICE keyboard mappings are far from being perfect and we are open
to any suggestions.

@node Command-line autostart,  , Command-line initialization, Usage
@section Autostarting programs from the command-line

It is possible to let the emulator @dfn{autostart} a disk or tape image
file, by simply specifying its name as the @emph{last} argument on the
command line, for example

@example
x64sc lovelygame.d64
@end example

will start the C64 emulator, attaching @file{lovelygame.d64} as a
disk image and running the first program on it.  You can also specify
the name of the program on the fisk image by appending a colon
(@samp{:}) the name itself to the argument; for example

@example
x64sc "lovelygame.d64:run me"
@end example

will run the program named @file{run me} on @file{lovelygame.d64}
instead of the first one.

@findex -autostart
Using the command-line option @code{-autostart} is equivalent; so the same
result can be obtained with

@example
x64sc -autostart "lovelygame.d64:run me"
@end example

If you specify a raw CBM or P00 file, the emulator will setup the file
system based drive emulation so that it is enabled and accesses the
directory containing the file first.  This is a very convenient way to
start multi-file programs stored in file system directories and not
requiring ``true'' drive emulation.

@xref{Disk and tape images}. for more information about images and
autostart.


@node System files, Basics, Usage, Top
@chapter System files

In order to work properly, the emulators need to load a few system
files:

@itemize @bullet

@item
the @dfn{system ROMs}, raw binary files containing copies of the original ROMs
of the machine you are emulating;

@item
the @dfn{keyboard maps}, text files describing the keyboard layout;

@item
the @dfn{palette files}, text files describing the colors of the machine you
are emulating.

@item
the @dfn{romset files}, text files describing the different ROMs to load.

@end itemize

The place where they will be searched for depends on the value of the
@code{Directory} resource, which is a colon (@code{:})-separated search
path list, like the @sc{unix} @code{PATH} environment variable.  The
default value is

@example
PREFIX/lib/vice/EMU:$HOME/.vice/EMU:BOOTPATH/EMU
@end example

Where @code{PREFIX} is the installation prefix (usually
@file{/usr/local}), @code{EMU} is the name of the emulated machine
(@code{C64}, @code{C64DTV}, @code{C128}, @code{PET},  @code{PLUS4}, @code{CBM-II}, @code{SCPU64}
or @code{VIC20}) and @code{BOOTPATH} is the directory where the executable resides.
The disk drive ROMs are looked for in a directory with @code{EMU} set to
@code{DRIVES}. @code{$HOME} is the user's home directory.

For example, if you have the C64 emulator installed in

@example
/usr/local/bin/x64
@end example

then the value will be

@example
/usr/local/lib/vice/C64:$HOME/.vice/C64:/usr/local/bin/C64
@end example

And system files will be searched for under the following directories,
in the specified order:

@enumerate 1
@item
@code{/usr/local/lib/VICE/C64}
@item
@code{$HOME/.vice/C64}
@item
@code{/usr/local/bin/C64}
@end enumerate

System files can still be installed in a different directory if you
specify a complete path instead of just a file name.  For example, if
you specify @file{./kernal} as the kernal image name, the kernal image
will be loaded from the current directory.  This can be done by using
command-line options or by modifying resource values (@pxref{Resource
files}).

@section ROM files

Every emulator requires its own ROM set.  For the VIC20 and the C64, the
ROM set consists of the following files:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@file{kernal},  the Kernal ROM (8 KBytes)

@item
@file{basic}, the Basic ROM (8 KBytes)

@item
@file{chargen}, the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

@end itemize

The C128 needs the following files:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@file{kernal}, the Kernal ROM (8 Kbytes)

@item
@file{basic}, the Basic + Editor ROM (32 Kbytes)

@item
@file{chargen}, the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

@end itemize

The C128, VIC20, SCPU64 and C64 emulators also need the following DOS ROMs for
the hardware-level emulation of the 1540, 1541, 1571, 1581, 2000 and 4000 disk
drives:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@file{dos1540}, the 1540 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

@item
@file{dos1541}, the 1541 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

@item
@file{dos1541II}, the 1541-II drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

@item
@file{dos1571}, the 1571 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

@item
@file{dos1581}, the 1581 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

@item
@file{dos2000}, the 2000 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

@item
@file{dos4000}, the 4000 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

@end itemize

In addition to those all emulators can handle
a parallel IEEE488 interface (the C64 and C128 via @code{$df**} extension,
the VIC20 via VIC1112 emulation)
so they also need the DOS ROM for the IEEE disk drives:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@file{dos2031}, the 2031 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)
(DOS 2.6, Commodore ROM images 901484-03 and 901484-05)

@item
@file{dos2040}, the 2040 drive ROM (8 Kbytes)
(DOS 1, Commodore ROM images 901468-06, 901468-07)

@item
@file{dos3040}, the 3040 drive ROM (12 Kbytes)
(DOS 2, Commodore ROM images 901468-11, 901468-12 and 901468-13)

@item
@file{dos4040}, the 4040 drive ROM (12 Kbytes)
(DOS 2, Commodore ROM images 901468-14, 901468-15 and 901468-16)

@item
@file{dos1001}, the 1001/8050/8250 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)
(DOS 2.7, Commodore ROM images 901887-01 and 901888-01)

@end itemize

Note that there are other DOS images on the internet. The DOS 2.5 images
might be used with the 8050, but it cannot handle the double sided drives
of the 1001 and 8250 and it is not supported by VICE.

The PET emulator uses an expanded setup, because there are three major
versions of the Basic and the Kernal, and many versions of the
Editor ROM. In addition there are cartridge ROM sockets.

The Kernal files contain the memory from range $F000-$FFFF, the Basic
ROMs either the range $C000-$DFFF or $B000-$DFFF.
To handle the different screen
sizes and keyboards, different so-called ``editor-ROMs'' for the memory
range $E000-$E800 are provided.
The PET ROMs have the following names:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@file{kernal1}, the PET2001 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM images 901447-06 and 901447-07)
@item
@file{kernal2}, the PET3032 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901465-03)
@item
@file{kernal4}, the PET4032/8032 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901465-22)

@item
@file{basic1}, the PET2001 Basic 1 ROM (8 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM images 901447-09, 901447-02, 901447-03, 901447-04.bin.
The -09 ROM is the revised -01 ROM)
@item
@file{basic2}, the PET3032 Basic 2 ROM (8 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM images 901465-01 and 901465-01)
@item
@file{basic4}, the PET4032/8032 Basic 4 ROM (12 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM images 901465-23, 901465-20 and 901465-21.
The -23 ROM is a revised -19 ROM)

@item
@file{edit1g}, the PET2001 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)

(Commodore ROM image 901474-04-?)

@item
@file{chargen}, the character generator ROM (2k).  It has two sets
with 128 chars each.  The second (inverted) half of each set is computed from
the first half by inverting it.  This is a PET hardware feature.
(Commodore ROM image 901447-10)
@item
@file{chargen.de}, the character generator ROM (2k). This version is a
patched German charset, with the characters [, \ and ] replaced by umlauts.
It has been provided by U. Guettich and he reports that it is supported
by some programs.

@item
@file{characters.901640-01.bin}, the SuperPET character generator ROM (4k).
The first half is the same as @file{chargen}, the second half contains,
instead of an upper and lower case set, an ASCII character set and an
APL character set. For these sets, the screen code is equal to the
ASCII/APL code.
@item
@file{waterloo-[abcdf]000.901898-0[1-5].bin},
@file{waterloo-e000.901897-01.bin}.
The Waterloo system ROMs.

@item
@file{hre-9000.324992-02.bin} HiRes Emulator (at $9000) and
@file{hre-a000.324993-02.bin} HiRes BASIC (at $A000).
These are the two roms for supporting the HRE on the 8296.
The ROMs are initialized by the command @code{SYS 36864}.
@end itemize

The PETs also have sockets for extension ROMs for the addresses
$9000-$9FFF, $A000-$AFFF and $B000-$BFFF (the last one for PET2001 and
PET3032 only).  You can specify ROM image files for those extensions
command line options @code{-petrom9}, @code{-petromA} and
@code{-petromB} resp.

An alternative would be to specify a long kernal ROM with the
@code{-kernal} option that includes the extension ROM areas.

Also, you can specify replacements for the basic ROM at $B000-$DFFF
with the @code{-petromBasic} option and for the editor ROM
at $E000-$E7FF with the @code{-petromEditor} option.

The CBM-II emulator again uses another setup.  For those models the
kernal used is the same for all.  However, for different amounts of
memory exist different versions of the BASIC ROMs.  The 128k RAM version
(C610, C710, B128) uses one bank of 64k for the BASIC text and another
one for all the variables.  The 256k RAM version uses one bank for text,
one for variables, one for arrays and one for strings.

Also the character generator ROMs have a format different from the
above.  The other character ROMs have 8 bytes of pixel data per
character.  Those ROMs have 16 bytes per character instead.  The C6x0
only uses the first 8 of it, but the C7x0 uses 14 lines per character
and needs those increased ROMs.  Both ROMs hold, like the PET, two
character sets with 128 characters each.  Again the second half of the
full (256 char) character set is computed by inverting.

@itemize @bullet

@item
@file{kernal}, the KERNAL (8k) for the business machines (6xx/7xx)

@end itemize

@node Keymap files, Palette files, ROM files, System files
@section Keymap files

@dfn{Keymap files} are used to define the keyboard layout, defining which
key (or combination of keys) must be mapped to each keysym.

In other words, the keyboard emulation works like this: whenever the
user presses or releases a key while the emulation window has the input
focus, the emulator receives an X-Window event with a value that
identifies that key.  That value is called a @dfn{keysym} and is unique
to that key.  The emulator then looks up that keysym in an internal
table that tells it which key(s) to press or release on the emulated
keyboard.

This table is described by the keymap file, which is made up of lines
like the following:

@example
KEYSYM ROW COLUMN SHIFTFLAG
@end example

Where:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{KEYSYM} is a string identifying the keysym: you can use the
@code{xev} utility (shipped with the X Window system) to see what keysym
is bound to any key;

@item
@code{ROW} and @code{COLUMN} identify the key on the emulated keyboard;

@item
@code{SHIFTFLAG} can have one of the following values:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{0}: the key is never shifted;

@item
@code{1}: the key is shifted;

@item
@code{2}: the key is the left shift;

@item
@code{4}: the key is the right shift;

@item
@code{8}: the key can be (optionally) shifted by the user.

@end itemize

@end itemize

The @code{SHIFTFLAG} is useful if you want certain keys to be
``artificially'' shifted by the emulator, and not by the user.  For
example, @key{F2} is shifted on the C64 keyboard, but you might want it
to be mapped to the unshifted @key{F2} key on the PC keyboard.  To do
so, you just have to use a line like the following:

@example
F2 0 4 1
@end example

where @code{0} and @code{4} identify the key (row 0, column 4 on the
keyboard matrix), and @code{1} specifies that every time the user presses
@key{F2} the shift key on the C64 keyboard must be pressed.

There are also some special commands you can put into the keyboard file;
they are recognized because they start with an exclamation mark:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{!CLEAR} clears the currently loaded keyboard map; it is
necessary to put this at the beginning of the file if you want the
keymap file to override all of the current internal settings;

@item
@code{!LSHIFT}, @code{!RSHIFT}, followed by a row and a column
value, specify where the left and right shift keys are located on the
emulated keyboard; for example, C64 default keymaps will specify

@example
!LSHIFT 1 7
!RSHIFT 6 4
@end example

@end itemize

Any line starting with the @code{#} sign, instead, is completely
ignored.  This is useful for adding comments within the keymap file.

VICE keymap files have the @file{.vkm} default extension, and every
emulator comes with a default positional mapping and a default symbolic
mapping.


@node Palette files, Romset files, Keymap files, System files
@section Palette files

@dfn{Palette files} are used to specify the colors used in the
emulators.  They are made up of lines like the following:

@example
RED GREEN BLUE DITHER
@end example

where @code{RED}, @code{GREEN} and @code{BLUE} are hexadecimal values
ranging from 0 to FF and specifying the amount of red, green and blue
you want for each color and @code{DITHER} is a 4-bit hexadecimal number
specifying the pattern you want when rendering on a B/W display.

You have to include as many lines as the number of colors the emulated
machine has, and the order of the lines must respect the one used in the
machine (so the N'th line must contain the specifications for color N -
1 in the emulated machine).

Lines starting with the @code{#} sign are completely ignored.  This is
useful for adding comments (such as color names) within the palette
file.

For example, the default PET palette file (which has only two colors, 0 for
background and 1 for foreground), looks like the following:

@example
#
# VICE Palette file
#
# Syntax:
# Red Green Blue Dither
#

# Background
00 00 00 0

# Foreground
00 FF 00 F
@end example

@node Romset files, , Palette files, System files
@section Romset files

The Romset files are not used by default on all emulators.
You might have recognized that the names of the ROM images are
saved in resources. Loading a Romset file now just means a `shortcut'
to changing all the resources with ROM image names and reloading
the ROMs.

The PET and CBM-II emulators use this feature to change between the
different ROM versions available for those machines. E.g. the
Romset file for the PET 2001 is

@example
KernalName="pet2001"
EditorName=
ChargenName="chargen"
RomModule9Name=
RomModuleAName=
RomModuleBName=
@end example

As you can see, the file even uses the same syntax as the
resource file, it is just a bit stripped down.

While a Romset file is processed, the directory where the Romset file
was found is temporarily prepended to the search path (@code{Directory}
resource). This also means that if you have a setting for
@code{Directory} in it, its effect is limited to the Romset file itself.

@node Emulation window, Menus, Basics, Basics
@section The emulation window

When the emulator is run, the screen of the emulated machine is
displayed in a standard X Window which we will call the @dfn{emulation
window}.  This window will be updated in real time, displaying the same
contents that a real monitor or TV set would.

Below the emulation window there is an area which is used to display
information about the state of the emulator; we will call this area the
@dfn{status bar}.

On the extreme left of the status bar, there is a @dfn{performance
meter}.  This displays the current relative speed of the emulator (as a
percentage) and the update frequency (in frames per second).  All the
machines emulated are PAL, so the update frequency will be 50 frames
per second if your system is fast enough to allow emulation at
the speed of the real machine.

On the extreme right of the status bar, there is a @dfn{drive status
indicator}.  This is only visible if the hardware-level (``True'') 1541
emulation is turned on.  In that case, the drive status indicator will
contain a rectangle emulating the drive LED and will display the current
track position of the drive's read/write head.

@node Menus, Help, Emulation window, Basics
@section Using the menus

It is possible to execute some commands and change emulation parameters
while the emulator is running: when the pointer is over the emulation
window, two menus are available by pressing either the left or right
mouse buttons.  The left mouse button will open the @dfn{command menu}
from which several emulation-related commands can be executed; the right
mouse button will open the @dfn{settings menu} from which emulation
parameters can be changed.  The basic difference between the command and
the settings menu is that, while commands have only effect on the
current session, settings can be saved and later used with the ``Save
settings'' and ``Load settings'' right-button menu items, respectively.
``Restore default settings'' restores the factory defaults.
@xref{Settings and resources}. for more information about how settings
work in VICE.

Sometimes commands can be reached via @dfn{shortcuts} or @dfn{hotkeys},
i.e., it is possible to execute them by pressing a sequence of keys
instead of going through the menu with the mouse.  Where shortcuts
exist, they are displayed in parentheses at the right edge of the menu
item.  In VICE, all shortcuts must begin with the @key{Meta} or
@key{Alt} key.  So, for example, to attach a disk image to drive #8 (the
corresponding menu item displays ``M-8''), you have to press the
@key{Meta} (or @key{Alt}) and then @key{8}.

Note that no other key presses are passed on to the emulated machine
while either @key{Meta} or @key{Alt} are held down.


@node Help, File Selector, Menus, Basics
@section Getting help

At any time, if you get stuck or do not remember how to perform a
certain action, you can use the ``Browse manuals'' command (from the help
menu).  This will open either the PDF or popup a browser and open the HTML
version of the documentation.  

Notice that on Linux this requires VICE to be properly (and fully) installed,
eg with a @samp{make install}.

@node File Selector, Disk and tape images, Help, Basics
@section Using the file selector

In those situations where it is necessary to specify a file name, all
of the VICE emulators will pop up a file selector window allowing
you to select or specify a file interactively.

To the left of the file selector, there is a list of ancestor
directories: by clicking on them, you can ascend the directory tree.  To
the right, there is a list of the files in the current directory; files
can be selected by clicking on them.  If you click on a directory, that
directory becomes the current one; if you click on an ordinary file, it
becomes the active selection.

At the top, there is a @dfn{directory box}, with the complete path of
the current directory, and a @dfn{file name box}, with the name of the
currently selected file.  At the bottom there are two buttons: ``OK''
confirms the selected file and ``Cancel'' abandons the file selector
without cancelling the operation.

It is also possible to specify what files you want to show in the file
selector by writing an appropriate shell-like pattern in the directory
box; e.g., @samp{~/*.[dx]64} will only show files in the home directory whose
name ends with either @file{.d64} or with @file{.x64}.


@node Disk and tape images, Reset, File Selector, Basics
@section Using disk and tape images

The emulator is able to emulate disk drives and tape
recorders if provided with suitable @dfn{disk images} or @dfn{tape
images}.  An @dfn{image} is a raw dump of the contents of the media, and
must be @dfn{attached} before the emulator can use it.  ``Attaching'' a
disk or tape image is like ``virtually'' inserting a diskette or a
cassette into the disk drive or the tape recorder: once an image is
attached, the emulator is able to use it as a storage media.

There are five commands (in the left button menu) that deal with disk
and tape images:

@itemize @bullet

@item
Attach Disk Image
@item
Detach Disk Image
@item
Attach Tape Image
@item
Detach Tape Image
@item
Smart-attach a file

@end itemize

The first four commands are used to insert and remove the virtual disks
and cassettes from the respective units.  On the other hand, the
last commands tries to guess the type of the image you are attaching
from its name and size, and attaches it to the most reasonable device.

Supported formats are @code{D64}, @code{G64}, @code{P64} and the ancient 
@code{X64} for disk images (devices 8, 9 and 10) and @code{T64} and @code{TAP} 
for tape images.  

Notice that @code{T64} support is @emph{read-only}, and that the cassette is 
automatically rewound when you reach its end. For actually emulating tape, the
@code{TAP} format is highly recommended.

Another important feature is that raw Commodore BASIC binary files and
.P00 files can be attached as tapes.  As you can autostart a
tape image when it is attached (@pxref{Autostart}), this allows you to
autostart these particular files as well.

You can attach a disk for which you do not have write permissions: when this
happens, the 1541 emulator will emulate a write-protected disk.  This is
also useful if you want to prevent certain disk images from being
written to; in the latter case, just remove the write permission for
that file, e.g., by doing a @code{chmod a-w}.

@subsection Previewing the image contents

It is possible to examine the directory of a disk or tape image before
attaching it.  Just press the ``Contents'' button in the file selector
window and a new window will pop up with the contents of the selected
image.

Notice that this function automatically translates the directory from
PETSCII to ASCII; but, due to differences in the two encodings, it is
not always possible to translate all the characters, so you might get
funny results when ``weird'' characters such as the semi-graphical ones
are being used.


@node Autostart, Compressed files, Previewing contents, Disk and tape images
@subsection ``Autostarting'' an image

If you want to reset the machine and run the first program on a certain
image without typing any commands at the Commodore BASIC prompt, you can
use the ``Autostart'' button in the file selector window after selecting
a proper disk or tape image file.

Notice that, if true drive emulation is turned on, it will be turned off
before running the program and then turned on again after it has been
loaded.  This way, you get the maximum possible speed while loading the
file, but you do not lose compatibility once the program itself is
running.

This method is not completely safe, because some autostarting methods
might cause the true drive emulation not to be turned on again.  In such
cases, the best thing to do is to disable kernal traps (which will cause
true drive emulation to be always kept turned on), or to manually load
the program with true drive emulation turned on.


@node Compressed files, Zipcode and Lynx, Autostart, Disk and tape images
@subsection Using compressed files

It is also possible to attach disk or tape images that have been
compressed through various algorithms; compression formats are
identified from the file extension.  The following formats are supported
(the expected file name extension is in parenthesis):

@itemize @bullet
@item
GNU Zip (@code{.gz} or @code{.z});
@item
BZip version 2 (@code{.bz2});
@item
PkZip (@code{.zip});
@item
GNU Zipped TAR archives (@code{.tar.gz}, @code{.tgz});
@item
Zoo (@code{.zoo}).
@end itemize

PkZip, @code{tar.gz}, @code{lha} and @code{zoo} support is
@emph{read-only} and always uses the @emph{first} @code{T64} or
@code{D64} file in the archive.  So archives containing multiple files
will always be handled as if they contain only a single file.

Windows and DOS don't contain the needful programs to handle
compressed archives. Get gzip and unzip for Windows at
@uref{ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/WIN32} and for DOS at
@uref{ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/MSDOS}. Don't use pkunzip
for DOS, it doesn't work. The programs to use BZip2 archives may be
found at @uref{http://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2}.
Just put the programs (unzip.exe, gzip.exe, bzip2.exe) into a directory
of your search path (e.g. C:\DOS or C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND; have a look at
the PATH variable).

@node Zipcode and Lynx,  , Compressed files, Disk and tape images
@subsection Using Zipcode and Lynx images

Since version 0.15, the VICE emulators have been able to attach disks
packed with Zipcode or Lynx directly, removing the need to manually
convert them into @code{D64} or @code{X64} files with @code{c1541}.
This is achieved by automatically invoking @code{c1541}, letting it
decode the file into a temporary image and attaching the resulting
temporary image read-only.  For this to work, the directory containing
@code{c1541} must be in your @code{PATH}.

This uses the @code{-unlynx} and @code{-zcreate} options of @code{c1541}
(@pxref{c1541 commands and options}); these commands are not very
reliable yet, and could fail with certain kinds of Lynx and Zipcode
images (for example, they cannot deal with @code{DEL} files properly).
So please use them with caution.

Lynx files usually come as @file{.lnx} files which are unpacked into
single disk images.  On the other hand, Zipcode files do not have a
particular extension (although @file{.z64} is sometimes used), and
represent a disk by means of component files, named as follows:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@file{1!NAME}
@item
@file{2!NAME}
@item
@file{3!NAME}
@item
@file{4!NAME}
@end itemize

If you attach as a disk image (or smart-attach) any one of these files,
the emulator will simply pick up the other three (by examining
the name) and then build a disk image using all four.


@node Reset,  , Disk and tape images, Basics
@section Resetting the machine

You can reset the emulated machine at any time by using the ``Reset''
command from the command menu.  There are two types of reset:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@dfn{soft reset}, which simply resets the CPU and all the other chips;
@item
@dfn{hard reset}, which also clears up the contents of RAM.
@end itemize

A @dfn{soft reset} is the same as a hardware reset achieved by pulling
the @sc{reset} line down; a @dfn{hard reset} is more like a power
on/power off sequence in that it makes sure the whole RAM is cleared.

It is possible that a soft reset may not be enough to take the machine
to the OS initialization sequence: in such cases, you will have to do a
hard reset instead.

This is especially the case for the CBM-II emulators.  Those machines
examine a memory location and if they find a certain "magic" value they
only do what you know from the C64 as @code{Run/Stop-Restore}.
Therefore, to really reset a CBM-II use hard reset.

@node Settings and resources, Machine-specific features, Basics, Top
@chapter Settings and resources

In the VICE emulators, all the settings are stored in entities known as
called @dfn{resources}.  Each resource has a name and a value which may
be either an integer or a string.  Integer values are often used as
boolean values with the usual convention of using zero for ``false''
and any other value for ``true''.

Resource values can be changed via the right-button menu (the
@dfn{settings} menu), via command-line options or via the @dfn{resource
file}.

The @dfn{resource file} is a human-readable file containing resource
values: it is called @file{vicerc} and is stored in the directory
@file{.vice/} in the user's home
directory.  It is possible to dump the current values of the resources
into that file or load the values stored into that file as the current
values, at any time.  This is achieved with the ``Save settings'' and
``Load settings'' right menu items.  A third menu item, ``Restore
Default Settings'', can be used to reset all the values to the factory
defaults.

A special resource, @code{SaveResourcesOnExit}, if set to a non zero
value, causes the emulator to ask you if you want to save the current
(changed) settings before exiting, and can be toggled with the ``Save
settings on exit'' command from the right-button menu.

Notice that not all the resources can be changed from the menus; some of
them can only be changed by manually modifying the resource file or by
using command-line options.

@node Resource files, Resources and command-line, Settings and resources, Settings and resources
@section Format of resource files

A resource file is made up of several sections; sections have the
purpose of separating the resources of a certain emulator from the ones
of the other emulators.  A section starts with the name of an
emulator in brackets (e.g., @samp{[C64]}) and ends when another section
starts or when the file ends.

Every line in a section has the following format:

@example
RESOURCE=VALUE
@end example

where @code{RESOURCE} is the name of a resource and @code{VALUE} is its
assigned value.  Resource names are case-sensitive and resource values
are either strings or integers.  Strings must start and end with a
double quote character (@code{"}), while integers must be given in
decimal notation.

Here is an example of a stripped-down @file{.vice/vicerc} file:

@example
[VIC20]
SaveResourcesOnExit=0
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/vic20p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1
[C64]
SaveResourcesOnExit=1
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/c64p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1
@end example

Notice that, when resource values are saved with ``Save settings'', the
emulator only modifies its own section, leaving the others unchanged.

@node Resources and command-line, Performance settings, Resource files, Settings and resources
@section Using command-line options to change resources

Resources can also be changed via command-line options.

Command-line options always override the defaults from @code{.vice/vicerc},
and their assignments last for the whole session.  So, if you specify a
certain command-line option that changes a certain resource from its
default value and then use ``Save Settings'', the value specified with
the command-line option will be saved back to the resource file.

Command-line options can begin with with a minus sign (@samp{-}) or
with a plus sign (@samp{+}).  Options beginning with a minus sign
may require an additional parameter, while the ones beginning with the
plus sign never require one.

Moreover, options beginning with a plus sign always have a counterpart
with the same name, but with a minus sign; in that case, the option
beginning with a minus sign is used to @emph{enable} a certain
feature, while the one beginning with a plus sign is used to
@emph{disable} the same feature (this is an X11 convention).  For
example, @code{-mitshm} enables support of MITSHM, while @code{+mitshm}
disables it.

@node Performance settings, Video settings, Resources and command-line, Settings and resources
@section Performance settings

@cindex Limiting emulation speed
It is possible to control the emulation speed by using the ``Maximum
speed'' menu item in the right-button menu.  The default setting is
@code{100}, which causes the emulation to never run faster than the real
machine.  A higher value allows the emulator to run faster, a lower one
may force it to run slower.  The setting ``No limit'' means to run as
fast as possible, without limiting speed.

@cindex Refresh rate
It is also possible to control the emulator's rate of frame update using
the ``Refresh rate'' setting; the value ranges from ``1/1'' (update 1/1
of the frames of the real machine, that is 50 frames per second) to
``1/10'' (update 1 every 10 frames) and can be changed via the ``Refresh
Rate'' submenu.  The ``Auto'' setting means to dynamically adapt the
refresh rate to the current speed of the host machine, making sure the
maximum speed specified by the via ``Maxium speed'' is always reached if
possible.  In any case, the refresh rate will never be worse than 1/10
if this option is specified.

Note that you cannot simultaneously specify ``Auto'' as the refresh rate
and ``No limit'' as the maximum speed..

@cindex Warp speed mode
Moreover, a special @dfn{warp speed} mode is provided and can be toggled
with the ``Enable Warp Mode'' menu item.  If this mode is enabled, it
will cause the emulator to disable any speed limit, turn sound emulation
off and use a 1/10 refresh rate, so that it will run at the maximum
possible speed.

``Video Cache'' enables a video cache that can speed up the emulation
when little graphics activity is going on; it is especially useful when

@subsection using openGL Rastersynchronization under X11

Warning: To get full retro experience with synchronization to the vertrical
raster retrace messing with X11 modelines (resolution and refresh frequencies)
is necessary. This description is a suggestion - Follow this instructions at
your own risk!

The following was tested under Ubuntu Linux (8.04) featuring Xorg Xserver 1:7.3+10ubuntu
and mesa openGL including HW support (NVIDIA driver) supporting glx version 1.4
supplying GLX_SGI_video_sync.

It is assumed that this works also on other systems supporting the
required extensions.

Preconditions:
@itemize @bullet
@item openGL extension GLX_SGI_video_sync in your X11 setup.
  The availability of the extension is checked at startup.

@item XRandR extension to switch proper modes (50Hz for PAL, 60Hz for
NTSC) is mandatory, proper modelines in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf must be present.
@end itemize

If your systems lacks 50 or 60Hz modes you might try using
`gtf' (typcally shipped with Xorg, xserver) - see related man page.

You might need to add the output such as:
@example
# 800x600 #@ 50.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 30.90 kHz; pclk: 31.15 MHz
Modeline "800x600_50.00" 31.15 800 824 904 1008 600 601 604 618 -HSync +Vsync
@end example
to you Monitor Section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add the resolution to the `Screen' section.

Sometimes some consistency checks within the display driver drop
this resolutions again.
To drop e.g. the autodetection features in the NVIDIA driver you
might add @code{Option "UseEDID" "FALSE"} in section @code{Device}.

XRandR cannot cope properly with the DynamicTwinView feature of the
proprietary nvidia driver. You might need

@code{Option         "DynamicTwinView" "False"}

to get proper results (in Screen or Device section of you xorg.conf).

ATTENTION: Disabling such features might allow X11 to access your HW
in a way that it gets damaged! You are at your own risk!

Enable fullscreen (not necessary, but makes sense):
@itemize @bullet
@item choose your preferred resolution/refresh XRandR Resolutions and
enable XRandR as fullscreen device (50Hz/PAL or 60Hz/NTSC mode).
@item Activate fullscreen with `Alt-D'.
@item choose `OpenGL Rastersynchronization' in the
video chip menu (VIC-II Settings, VIC Setting, etc.)
@end itemize

Note that:
@itemize @bullet
@item the current implementation is dropping synchronization
silently in case the display frequency isn't aligned (50Hz
for PAL, 60Hz for NTSC).

@item On some systems the XRandR system isn't informed about desktop
display frequency changes if you switch resolutions via hotkeys like
CTRL-Alt-+ (Numpad), which is possible e.g. with the X11
implementation of Xorg.

In that case you can override/tell the current frequency via menu:
Settings->VICII Settings->Desktop Refreshrate (e.g. in x64)
(this shouldn't be necessary if you use fullscreen via XRandR.

The following menu items control sound output:

@itemize @bullet

@cindex Turning sound playback on/off
@item
``Enable sound playback'' turns sound emulation on and off.

@cindex Sound syncronization
@cindex Sound speed adjustment
@item
``Sound synchronization'' specifies the method for syncronizing the
sound playback.  Possible settings are:
@itemize @bullet
@item
``Flexible'', i.e., the audio renderer flexibly adds/removes samples to
the output to smoothly adapt the playback to slight changes in the speed
of the emulator.
@item
``Adjusting'' works like ``flexible'', but supports bigger differences
in speed.  For example, if the emulation speed drops down from from 100%
to 50%, audio slows down by the same amount too.
@item
``Exact'', instead, makes the audio renderer output always the same
sounds you would hear from the real thing, without trying to adapt the
ratio; to compensate the tolerances in speed, some extra frames will be
skipped or added.
@end itemize

@cindex Sample rate
@item
``Sample rate'' specifies the sampling frequency, ranging from 8000 to
48000 Hz (not all the sound cards and/or sound drivers can support all
the frequencies, so actually the nearest candidate will be chosen).

@cindex Audio buffer size
@cindex Sound buffer size
@item
``Buffer size'' specifies the size of the audio buffer; the bigger the
buffer, the longer the delay with which sounds are played.  You should
pick the smallest value your machine can handle without problems.

@cindex Sound suspend time
@item
``Sound suspend time'', will cause the audio playback to pause for the
specified number of seconds whenever some clicking happens.  If ``Keep
going'' is selected, no pausing is done.

The following menu items control sound input:

@cindex Sampler Device
@item
``Sampler Device'' specifies the host device/method used for sampling/sound input,
currently portaudio (if linked in) and file methods are supported.

@cindex Sampler Gain
@item
``Sampler Gain'' specifies the amount of gain (increase the input volume if above 100
or decrease the input volume if below 100) for the input of the sampler device.

@cindex Sampler File
@item
``Sampler File'' specifies the name of the file to be uses as an input source for
the 'file' method/device.

@section Drive settings

These settings are used to control the hardware-level emulation of the Disk
drives.  When hardware-level emulation is turned on, only drives 8 and 9
are being emulated.

The following settings affect both drives:

@itemize @bullet

@item
``Enable true drive emulation'' enables the (slow) hardware-level
emulation of the drives for maximum compatibility.  This must be turned
on for any of the following settings to have effect.

@item
``Drive sync factor'' specifies the speed of the drive's CPU.  This can
be used to help loading certain programs that have trouble with the
default PAL setting (for example, programs designed for NTSC machines).
The ratio is calculated as follows:

@example
sync_factor = 65536 * clk_drive / clk_machine
@end example

where @code{clk_drive} and @code{clk_machine} are clock speeds in MHz.
The menu lets you choose between the PAL and NTSC values, and also lets
you specify whatever value you want.  Be careful when changing it,
though, because a wrong value can break things and even corrupt disk
images.

@end itemize

The following settings, instead, are specific of each drive:

@itemize @bullet

@item
``Drive model'' specifies the model of the drive being emulated.
@strong{Warning:} This will reset the drive.

@item
``Enable parallel cable'' enables emulation of a SpeedDOS parallel
cable; if you switch this option on and replace the original Commodore
ROMs with SpeedDOS-compatible ones, you can speed up loading/saving times.

@item
``Idle method'' specifies which method the drive emulation should use to
save CPU cycles in the host CPU.  There are three methods:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@dfn{Skip cycles}: Each time the serial line is accessed by the C64, the
drive executes all the cycles since the last time it ran.  If
the number of elapsed cycles is larger than a certain value, the drive
discards part of them.
@item
@dfn{Trap idle}: The disk drive is still emulated upon serial line
accesses as with the previous option, but it is also always emulated at
the end of each screen frame.  If the drive gets into the DOS idle loop,
only pending interrupts are emulated to save time.
@item
@dfn{No traps}: Like ``Trap idle'', but without any traps at all.  So
basically the drive works exactly as with the real thing, and nothing is
done to reduce the power needs of the drive emulation.
@end itemize

The first option (``Skip cycles'') is usually best for performance, as
the drive is emulated as little as possible; on the other hand, you may
notice sudden slowdowns (when the drive executes several cycles at once)
and the LED status is never updated (because it would not be possible to
do correctly so).  Moreover, if the drive tries to get in sync with the
computer in some weird way and the computer does not access the serial
line for a long time, it is possible that some cycles are discarded and
the sync is lost.  Notice that this hack will have no effect on
performance if a program continuously reads from the IEC port, as the
drive will have to be fully emulated in any case (some stupid programs
do this, even when they don't actually need to use the drive).

@c without this, texi2html strips our end-of-paragraph away.
@c maybe we should patch it?
@ifhtml
<P>
@end ifhtml

The second option (``Trap idle'') is usually a bit slower, as at least
interrupts are always emulated, but ensures the LED state is always
updated correctly and always keeps the drive and the computer in sync.
On the other hand, if a program installs a non-standard idle loop in the
drive, the drive CPU has to be emulated even when not necessary and the
global emulation speed is then @emph{much} slower.

@item
``40-track image support'' specifies how 40-track (``extended'') disk
images should be supported.  There are three possible ways:

@itemize @bullet
@item
``Never extend'' never extends disk images at all (so if a program tries
to write tracks beyond the 35th, it is not allowed to do so);
@item
``Ask on extend'' prompts the user as soon as a program tries to write
tracks beyond the 35th, and the user can then choose whether he wants
the disk image to be extended or not;
@item
``Extend on access'' simply extends the disk image as soon the program
needs it, without prompting the user.

@section Peripheral settings

VICE is able to support some special peripherals:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@dfn{file system devices}, pseudo-drives accessing the Unix file system;
@item
printers.
@end itemize

These features depend on some @dfn{kernal traps} that replace the
existing routines in the original Commodore operating system with
custom-made C routines.

@menu
* File system device settings::  Settings for file system devices.
* Printer settings::            Settings for emulating a printer.
* No kernal traps::             Disabling kernal traps completely.
@end menu

@node File system device settings, Printer settings, Peripheral settings, Peripheral settings
@subsection Settings for file system devices

These settings deal with the drive-like peripherals connected to the bus
of the emulated machine.
The first setting relates to the parallel IEEE488 interface. With
this interface a special engine is used to listen to the bus lines
to translates them to the filesystem code. Thus the PET will always
detect a drive for example, but it can also use drives 10 and 11 even
together with true disk drive emulation.

@itemize @bullet
@item
``Enable virtual devices'', enables the peripheral access via
the fast disk emulation (either kernal traps or IEEE488 interface).
Both, filesystem and disk image access via fast
drive emulation, are affected.
@end itemize

Four peripherals, numbered from 8 to 11, are
accessible; each of them provides the following settings:

@itemize @bullet
@item
``File system access'', if enabled, allows the device to emulate a drive
accessing a file system directory; note that when a disk image is
attached to the same drive, the directory is no longer visible and the
attached disk is used instead.
@item
``File system directory'' specifies the directory to be accessed by the
drive.
@item
``Convert P00 file names'', if enabled, allows access to P00 files using
their built-in name instead of the Unix one.
@item
``Create P00 files on save'', if enabled, creates P00 files (instead of
raw CBM files) whenever a program creates a file.
@end itemize

Note that, by default, all drives create P00 files on save.

@node Printer settings, No kernal traps, File system device settings, Peripheral settings
@subsection Printer settings

The VICE emulators can emulate printers connected to either the IEC
buffer or the user port.  Emulation can be achieved by redirecting the
printer output to a file or by piping it through an external process.
This is defined by so-called @dfn{printer device file names}; a printer
device file name can be either a simple path, or a command name
preceeded by a pipe symbol @samp{|}.

For example, printer device @samp{filename} will cause the output to be
appended to the file @file{filename}, while printer device @samp{|lpr}
will cause the @code{lpr} command to be executed and be fed the printer
output.  The printer output will not be converted but saved as printed
by the emulated machine.

Up to three printer devices may be specified through the following
resources:

@itemize @bullet
@item
device 1, whose default value is @code{print.dump};
@item
device 2, whose default value is @code{|lpr}.
@item
device 3, whose default value is @code{|petlp -F PS|lpr};
@end itemize

So, basically, by default printer device 1 will dump printer
output to @file{print.dump}; printer device 2 will print it via
@code{lpr} directly to the printer and device 3 will print it via
@code{petlp} (a not-yet-complete utility that will produce Postscript
output from the Commodore printer code) and then to the printer via
@code{lpr}.

@node RS232 settings, Monitor settings, Peripheral settings, Settings and resources
@section RS232 settings

The VICE emulators can emulate the RS232 device most of the machines
have.  The C64, C128 and VIC20 emulators emulate the userport RS232
interface at 300 and 1200 baud.  The C64 and C128 can also use the 9600
baud interface by Daniel Dallmann, using the shift registers of the two
CIA 6526 chips.  The PET can have a 6551 ACIA RS232 interface when
running as a SuperPET, and the CBM-II has such an ACIA by default.  The
C64 and C128 emulators can emulate an ACIA 6551 (also known as Datapump
for example) as extension at @code{$de**}.

Emulation can be achieved by either:

@itemize @bullet
@item
connecting a real UNIX serial device;
@item
dumping to a file;
@item
piping through a process.
@end itemize

It is possible to define up to four UNIX serial devices, and then decide
which interface should be connected to which device.  This is done by
so-called @dfn{rs232 device file names}; an rs232 device file name can
be either a simple path, or a command name preceeded by a pipe symbol
@samp{|}.  If the path specifies a special device (e.g. @file{/dev/ttyS0}) it
is recognized by VICE and the emulator can set the baudrate.

For example, rs232 device @samp{filename} will cause the output to be
written (not appended) to the file @file{filename}, while printer device
@samp{|lpr} will cause the @code{lpr} command to be executed and be fed
the rs232 output.  The rs232 output will not be converted but saved as
sent by the emulated machine.  The same holds true for the rs232 input.
If the command writes data to the standard output it will be caught by VICE
and sent back to the emulator.  Also the data sent by the pseudo device will
be sent back to VICE.

For example you can setup a null-modem cable between two serial ports
of your PC, setup one port for login and use the other in VICE.  Then you
can login from your emulator via the RS232 emulation and the null-modem
cable to your machine again.

You can not simply run a shell from VICE, as the shell will notice that
it does not run on its own pseudo terminal and will thus buffer its
output.  You need to write some program that opens an own pseudo terminal
and runs the shell from there (not yet finished).

Up to four RS232 devices may be specified through the following
resources:

@itemize @bullet
@item
device 1, whose default value is @code{/dev/ttyS0};
@item
device 2, whose default value is @code{/dev/ttyS1};
@item
device 3, whose default value is @code{rs232.dump};
@item
device 4, whose default value is @code{|lpr}.
@end itemize

For the first two devices you can change the baudrate the tty device is
set to by specifying it on the commandline or in the menu.  This
baudrate is 9600 by default for the latter two, but can be changed only
by resources (The baudrate is independent from the baudrate the emulator
actually expects).

@subsection RS232 usage example

Here we give you a simple example how to set up an emulated C64 using
the modem connected to your PC. The following list shows each step.

@table @code
@item Attach your modem to your PC at a serial port.
Normally you should set it up to use the modem as "/dev/modem".
@item start VICE

@item Setup VICE to use your modem as "serial device 1"
Go to the RS232 settings menu and change "Serial 1 device" to "/dev/modem" (or the device where you attached your modem to)
Then go to the RS232 settings menu and change "Serial 1 baudrate" to the baudrate your modem should run at.
  Watch out, e.g. on Linux there is an additional multiplier
  to multiply with the baudrate (so e.g. 19200 gives 115200 or so baud)
  See the "setserial" manpage on Linux for example.
  However, most modems should be able to autodetect the speed to
  the computer as well.

@item Select the RS232 emulation your programs use
If you want to use the Userport emulation, go to the RS232 settings and
  change "Userport RS232 Device" to
  "Serial 1". If you want ACIA emulation (swiftlink or what's it called?)
  then change "ACIA $DE** device" to "Serial 1".

@item Enable the emulation
  Go to the RS232 settings and select either "ACIA $DE** emulation"
  or Userport 300/1200 baud or CIA 9600 baud emulation.

@item Load your program and start it.
If it is able to detect an
  RS232 cartridge like swiftlink or so, try to detect the ACIA emulation
  if enabled.
  Otherwise just set the baudrate to either 300, 1200 or 9600 according
  to what you enabled in the VICE menu for the userport.

@subsection Using cartridges

The cartridge system is organized in "Slots" to allow more than one cartridge
connected at a time, like it can be done using an expansion port expander on
a real C64 (see below).

Generally a cartridge can be enabled by attaching its respective cartridge
image, or using the respective menu option for cartridges that do not
require an image.

x64, x64sc and x128 allow you to attach the following kinds of images:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@file{.crt} images, as used by the CCS64 emulator by Per Håkan Sundell
@item
raw @file{.bin} images, with or without load address
@end itemize

@dfn{Cartridge images} are like disk images, but contain the contents of
cartridge ROM and/or RAM images instead of disk images.

To attach cartridges, use the ``Attach a cartridge image'' submenu. When using
@file{.crt} images, this will work for every cartridge which is supported. For
raw @file{.bin} images you might have to use command line options.

When you have successfully attached a cartridge image,
you should then reset the machine to make sure the cartridge initializes
itself. (Or enable the "reset on cartridge change" option).

Of course, it is also possible to detach a currently attached
cartridge image (``Detach cartridge image'').

If you are using a freezer cart like an Action Replay cartridge, you can
emulate the cartridge's freeze button with the ``Cartridge freeze''
command.

The imaginary expansion port expander is organized in 4 slots, the
cartridges are associated with them like this:

@c @node FIXME
@subsubsection Slot 0

All carts that have a passthrough connector go here. Once a "Slot 0"
cartridge is enabled all further cartridges are connected to its respective
passthrough port.

Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.

"Slot 0" carts have individual "enable" switches, enabling means enabling permanently.

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

@itemize @bullet

@item

@end itemize

@c @node FIXME
@subsubsection Slot 1

Mostly RAM based cartridges which for one reason or the other might make sense
to be enabled together with one of the "Main Slot" cartridges go here.

Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.

"Slot 1" carts have individual "enable" switches, enabling means enabling permanently

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Double Quick Brown Box (DQBB)
@item
Expert Cartridge
@item
ISEPIC
@item
RamCart
@end itemize

@c @node FIXME
@subsubsection Main Slot

All other cartridges which are not pure i/o extensions go here.

Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.

Cartridges in the "Main Slot" must be explicitly set as default to enable them permanently.

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

@itemize @bullet
@item
generic 4K, 8K and 16K game- and ultimax cartridges

@subsubsection I/O Slot

All carts that are pure I/O extensions go here.

Any number of "I/O Slot" Carts may be active at a time.

"I/O Slot" carts have individual "enable" switches, enabling means enabling permanently.

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

@itemize @bullet
@item
ACIA (Swiftlink, Turbo232)
@item
DigiMAX
@item
DS12C887 RTC
@item
Ethernet (The Final Ethernet, RR-Net)
@item

@item
RAM Expansion Module (REU)
@item
SFX Sound Expander
@item
SFX Sound Sampler
@end itemize

@c @node FIXME
@subsubsection Expected behaviour

When the emulator is run without arguments, all settings from the config file
should be applied and arguments override settings from the config file.

When saving the settings to the config file it is expected that on the next run
of the emulator all settings will be in the same state as they were when saved.

There is an exception to this rule: the cartridge in the "Main Slot" must be
explicitly set as default before it gets saved to the config file.

@code{+cart} should disable ALL cartridges, including eventually activated REU,
Swithlink and all similar expansionport devices.

@code{-cartXYZ} options should generally attach AND activate a cart of type XYZ.
As a consequence, attaching carts this way which are NOT in the "Main Slot" will
also enable the cart permanently.

@c @node FIXME
@subsubsection Common problems

If attaching a cartridge does not work as expected, this may be because of various
reasons:

@itemize @bullet

@item Not seldomly the CRT type is incorrectly set in @code{.crt} files found "in the wild".
Make sure this is not the case (if in doubt use @code{cartconv} to verify and/or fix).

@item You may have unintentionally enabled more than one cartridge at once, for
example by saving the settings with REU enabled, and then later attaching a game
cartridge from the command-line. The cartridge system will allow certain combinations,
but (as on the real thing) not all do (can) actually work. To make sure this is
not the case, either detach all cartridges from the menus, or use @code{+cart}
on the command-line.

@item The cartridge image might be broken. Try one from a different source. If you
are sure the dump is ok (for example because you dumped it yourself) then make sure
it is in proper linear order (on some cartridges, for example "capture", address and/or
data lines at the eprom are shuffled around so a dump made with an eprom burner can not
be used as is).

@item Last not least you might have encountered a bug in the emulation. If you
suspect this is the case, and you can still reproduce the bug after checking the
things above, please file a bug report including the following information:

@itemize @bullet
@item attach your vicerc and a reference to the cartridge binaries
@item if you can, comment in the respective DEBUGXYZ macros prominently defined at the
top of these files: src/c64/cart/c64cart.c src/c64/cart/c64cartmem.c src/c64/c64io.c
src/c64/c64export.c and then recompile. this will add debug output that might make
it much easier to locate certain problems.
@end itemize

@end itemize

@c @node FIXME
@subsubsection IEEE-488 interface

To be able to use an IEEE drive, you need to enable IEEE emulation for the
emulator. To do this, follow the following steps:

Download the IEEE 488 ROM image from the CBM archives (formerly known as FUNET)
Attach that image with File/Attach cartridge image/IEEE488 interface image.

Make sure you have a one-drive system only (that is, go to Settings/Peripheral
Setting, uncheck "use IEC device" for all devices, go to Settings/Drive Settings
and select "Floppy type" as "none" for all drives other than drive 8.

After this, all drives can be selected in x64 and x128.

@c @node FIXME
@subsubsection The Final Cartridge 3
The Final Cartridge 3 detects whether a mouse is connected when it starts and
disables mouse support if it doesnt detect one. So to make mouse emulation
work you must either enable it on the command line, or reset the cartridge
after enabling it from the user interface.

@node VIC-II settings, SID settings, C64 cartridges, C64/128-specific
@subsection VIC-II settings

These settings control the emulation of the VIC-II (MOS6569) video chip
used in both the C64 and the C128.

@itemize @bullet

@cindex Sprite collision detection
@item
``Sprite-sprite collisions'' and ``Sprite-background collisions'', if
enabled, cause the hardware detection of sprite-to-sprite and
sprite-to-background collisions of the VIC-II to be emulated.  This
feature is used by many games, and disabling either of the two detection
systems can sometimes make you invincible (although there is also a
chance that also enemies become invincible then).

@cindex VIC-II color sets
@item
``Color set'' can be used to dynamically change the palette file being used by
choosing one of the available predefined color sets, for example:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@file{pepto-pal.vpl} (``Pepto PAL''), a Palette calculated by Philip "Pepto" Timmermann
(@uref{http://www.pepto.de/projects/colorvic/}). (This is the default)
@item
@file{vice.vpl} (``VICE''), the old default VICE palette.
@item
@file{c64s.vpl} (``C64S''), palette taken from the shareware C64S emulator by Miha Peternel.
@item
@file{ccs64.vpl} (``CCS64''), palette taken from the shareware CCS64 emulator by Per Håkan Sundell.
@item
@file{frodo.vpl} (``Frodo''), palette taken from the free Frodo emulator by Christian Bauer
(@uref{https://frodo.cebix.net/}).
@item
@file{pc64.vpl} (``PC64''), palette taken from the free PC64 emulator by Wolfgang Lorenz.

(@uref{https://www.godot64.de}).

@subsection SID settings

These settings control the emulation of the SID (MOS6581 or MOS8580)
audio chip.

@itemize @bullet

@cindex Second SID
@item
``Second SID'' maps a second SID chip into the address space for stereo
sound. This emulates e.g. the ``SID Symphony Stereo Cartridge'' from
Dr. Evil Laboratories. The second SID can be used with software such as
``Stereo SID Player'' by Mark Dickenson or ``The Enhanced Sidplayer'' by
Craig Chamberlain.

@cindex Second SID base address
@item
``Second SID base address'' sets the start address for the second SID
chip. Software normally uses $DE00 or $DF00, since $DE00-$DEFF and
$DF00-$DFFF can be mapped through the cartridge port of the C64. The
default start address is $DE00.

@cindex SID filters
@item
``Emulate filters'' causes the built-in programmable filters of the SID
chip to be emulated.  A lot of C64 music requires them to be emulated
properly, but their emulation requires some additional processor power.

@cindex SID models
@item
``ChipModel'' specifies the model of the SID chip being emulated: there
are two slightly different generations of SID chips: MOS6581 ones and
MOS8580 ones.

@cindex Toggling reSID emulation
@item
``Use reSID emulation'' specifies whether the more accurate (and
resource hungry) reSID emulation is turned on or off.

@cindex reSID samping method
@item
``reSID sampling method'' selects the method for conversion of the SID
output signal to a sampling rate appropriate for playback by standard
digital sound equipment. Possible settings are:
@itemize @bullet
@item
``Fast'' simply clocks the SID chip at the output sampling frequency,
picking the nearest sample. This yields acceptable sound quality, but
sampling noise is noticeable in some cases, especially with SID combined
waveforms. The sound emulation is still cycle exact.
@item
``Interpolating'' clocks the SID chip each cycle, and calculates each
sample with linear interpolation. The sampling noise is now strongly
attenuated by the SID external filter (as long as ``Emulate filters'' is
selected), and the linear interpolation further improves the sound
quality.
@item
``Resampling'' clocks the SID chip each cycle, and uses the
theoretically correct method for sample generation. This delivers CD
quality sound, but is extremely CPU intensive, and is thus most useful
for non-interactive sound generation. Unless you have a very fast
machine, that is.
@end itemize

@cindex reSID resampling passband
@item ``reSID resampling passband'' specifies the percentage of the
total bandwidth allocated to the resampling filter passband. The work
rate of the resampling filter is inversely proportional to the remaining
transition band percentage. This implies that e.g. with the transition
band starting at ~ 20kHz, it is faster to generate 48kHz than 44.1kHz
samples. For CD quality sound generation at 44.1kHz the passband
percentage should be set to 90 (i.e. the transition band starting at
almost 20kHz).

@subsection C64DTV ROM image

The DTV has a 2MB Flash chip which contains the kernal, basic and
character set ROMs along with other data, such as games in the case of
the original C64DTV ROM.

The image file is a dump of the flash chip. It is exactly 2MB (2097152 bytes).

If you do not have a suitable image file, an image using the C64 kernal,
basic and charset is automatically created.

If writing to the C64DTV ROM is enabled, the image file is rewritten with
the current data when exiting x64dtv.

Note that x64dtv tries to load the image file from the C64DTV
directory first, and if it isn't found there, x64dtv tries to
load it from the current directory. If you do not have @file{dtvrom.bin}
in your C64DTV directory and writing to DTV ROM is enabled,
the @file{dtvrom.bin} file is created to the current directory.

NOTE: The original C64DTV ROM has somewhat distorted colors,
normally you should use a patched rom.

@table @code

@findex -c64dtvromimage

@subsection LumaFix

The PAL C64DTVs have wrong resistors in the video output circuit,
which causes incorrect luminances. Several hardware solutions
("LumaFixes") have been developed to fix this flaw.

The fixed video output is emulated by selecting "New Luminances".
The unmodified C64DTV video output can be emulated with "Old Luminances".

The default setting is "New Luminances".


@node Userport, Debug, LumaFix, C64DTV-specific
@subsection Userport

The C64DTV userport emulation currently supports three devices:
Hummer ADC, userport joystick and PS/2 mouse.

The joystick that controls either the Hummer ADC or userport joystick
can be selected using the same parameter or menu option.

While using the Hummer ADC, joystick UP and DOWN are mapped to
the Hummer buttons A and B respectively. LEFT and RIGHT set the ADCs
output to 0 and 255. Centering the joystick results in the ADC value of 128.

Currently the Hummer ADC and userport joystick are mutually exclusive.
This means that enabling one disables the other. PS/2 mouse emulation
can be used simultaneously with either Hummer ADC or userport joystick.

@subsection Monitor DTV features

Currently the registers A, Y and X are registers R0, R1 and R2 regardless of
the mapping, which can be seen and modified via the registers ACM and XYM.

The monitor can access all 2MB of RAM and 2MB of Flash, but only 64 kB at a time.
The 64kB bank can be selected with "bank ram00".."ram1f" for RAM and
"bank rom00".."rom1f" for Flash.

The "load" command can load large files (>64kB) correctly if the bank is set
to "ramXX", where XX is the starting bank (usually "bank00").

@subsection Using cartridge images

As with the C64 (@pxref{C64 cartridges}), it is possible to attach
several types of cartridge images:

@itemize @bullet
@item
4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $2000;
@item
4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $4000;
@item
4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $6000;
@item
4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $A000;
@item
4 Kbyte cartridges located at $B000.
@end itemize

This can all be done via the ``Attach cartridge image@dots{}'' command in
the left-button menu.  It is also possible to let xvic ``guess'' the
type of cartridge using ``Smart-attach cartridge image@dots{}''.

Notice that several cartridges are actually made up of two pieces (and
two files), that need to be loaded separately at different addresses.
In that case, you have to know the addresses (which are usually
specified in the file name) and use the ``attach'' command twice.

A special kind of cartridge file is where the two files mentioned
above are concatenated (with removing the two byte load address of
the second image) into one 16k image. There are only few of those
images, though. Normally the second part is located at $A000.
Vice can now attach such concatenated files at the start address
$2000, $4000, and $6000. The second half of such an image is
moved to $A000. If you encounter 16k images that have the second
half not at $A000 you can split the image into two halfs
(i.e. one 8194 byte and one 8192 byte, because the first has the load
address) and attach both files separately.

One cartridge that is currently only partially supported here is
the VIC1112 IEEE488 interface. You have to load the ROM as a cartridge,
but you also have to enable the IEEE488 hardware by menu.

@subsection Changing memory configuration

It is possible to change the VIC20 memory configuration in two ways: by
enabling and/or disabling certain individual memory blocks, or by
choosing one among a few typical memory configurations.  The former can
be done by modifying resource values directly or from the right-button
menu; the latter can only be done from the menu.

There are 5 RAM expansion blocks in the VIC20, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 and
5:

@itemize @bullet
@item
block 0 (3 Kbytes at $0400-$0FFF);
@item
block 1 (8 Kbytes at $2000-$3FFF);
@item
block 2 (8 Kbytes at $4000-$5FFF);
@item
block 3 (8 Kbytes at $6000-$7FFF);
@item
block 5 (8 Kbytes at $A000-$BFFF).
@end itemize

These blocks are called @dfn{expansion blocks} because they are not
present a stock (``unexpanded'') machine.  Each of them is associated to
a boolean @code{RamBlockX} resource (where @code{X} is the block number)
that specifies whether the block is enabled or not.

There are also some common memory configurations you can pick from the
right-button menu:

@itemize @bullet
@item
no RAM expansion blocks at all;
@item
all RAM expansion blocks enabled;
@item
3K expansion (only block 0 is enabled);
@item
8K expansion (only block 1 is enabled);
@item
16K expansion (only blocks 1 and 2 are enabled);
@item
24K expansion (only blocks 1, 2 and 3 are enabled).

@subsubsection VIC20 memory configuration command-line options

@table @code

@findex -memory
@item -memory <config>
Specify memory configuration. It must be a comma-separated list of
options, each of which can be one the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{none} (no extension);
@item
@code{all} (all blocks);
@item
@code{3k} (3k space in block 0);
@item
@code{8k} (first 8k extension block);
@item
@code{16k} (first and second 8k extension blocks);
@item
@code{24k} (first, second and 3rd extension blocks);
@item
@code{0}, @code{1}, @code{2}, @code{3}, @code{5} (memory in respective
blocks);
@item
@code{04}, @code{20}, @code{40}, @code{60}, @code{A0} (memory at respective address.
@end itemize

For example,

@example
xvic -memory none
@end example

gives an unexpanded VIC20.  While

@example
xvic -memory 60,a0
@end example

or

@example
xvic -memory 3,5
@end example

enables memory in blocks 3 and 5, which is the usual configuration for
16k ROM modules.

@subsection Changing PET model settings

With @code{xpet}, it is possible to change at runtime the
characteristics of the emulated PET so that it matches (or not) the ones
of a certain PET model, and it is also possible to select from a common
set of PET models so that all the features are selected accordingly.

The former is done by changing the following resources (via resource
file, command line options or right-menu items):

@table @code

@vindex RamSize
@item RamSize
Integer specifying the size of the memory in kByte. 96k denotes an 8096, 128k an 8296.
(4, 8, 16, 32, 96, 128)

@vindex IOSize
@item IOSize
Integer specifying the size of the I/O area in Bytes for the 8296 model.
(256, 2048)

@vindex VideoSize
@item VideoSize
Integer specifying the number of columns on the screen.
(0: Automatic from ROM, 40: 40 columns, 80: 80 columns)

@vindex Ram9
@item Ram9
Boolean specifying if the 8296 can map RAM into the address range $9*** or not.

@vindex RamA
@item RamA
Boolean specifying if the 8296 can map RAM into the address range $A*** or not.

@vindex SuperPET
@item SuperPET
Boolean that enables/disables the SuperPET (MicroMainFrame 9000) I/O and 6809 CPU,
and disables/enables the 8x96 mappings.

@vindex Basic1
@item Basic1
Boolean to enable/disable the patching of a version 1 kernal ROM to make the IEEE488 interface work.

@vindex Basic1Chars
@item Basic1Chars
Boolean to enable/disable the exchanges of some characters in the character ROM
that have changed between the first PET 2001 and all newer versions.

@vindex EoiBlank
@item EoiBlank
Boolean to enable/disable the "blank screen on EOI" feature of the oldest PET 2001.

@vindex DiagPin
@item DiagPin
Boolean to enable/disable the diagnostic pin on the PET userport (see below).

@vindex ChargenName
@item ChargenName
String specifying the name of the character generator ROM (default @file{chargen}).

@vindex KernalName
@item KernalName
String specifying the name of the Kernal ROM (default @file{kernal4}).

@vindex BasicName
@item BasicName
String specifying the name of the Basic ROM (default @file{basic4}).

@vindex EditorName
@item EditorName
String specifying the filename of the editor ROM file. This file contains
an overlay for the editor ROM at $E000-$E7FF if necessary.

@vindex RomModule9Name
@item RomModule9Name
String specifying the filename for the $9*** Expansion ROM file. This file contains
an expansion ROM image of 4k.

@vindex RomModuleAName
@item RomModuleAName
String specifying the filename for the $A*** Expansion ROM file. This file contains
an expansion ROM image of 4k.

@vindex RomModuleBName
@item RomModuleBName
String specifying the filename for the $B*** Expansion ROM file. This file contains
an expansion ROM image of 4k. This file overlays the lowest 4k of a BASIC 4 ROM.

@end table

Choosing a common PET model is done from the right-button menu instead,
by choosing an item from the ``Model defaults'' submenu.  Available
models are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
PET 2001-8N
@item
PET 3008
@item
PET 3016
@item
PET 3032
@item
PET 3032B
@item
PET 4016
@item
PET 4032
@item
PET 4032B
@item
PET 8032
@item
PET 8096
@item
PET 8296
@item
SuperPET
@end itemize

Notice that this will @strong{reset the emulated machine}.

It is also possible to select the PET model at startup, with the
@code{-model} command-line option: for example, @samp{xpet -model 3032}
will emulate a PET 3032 while @samp{xpet -model 8296} will emulate a PET
8296.

It is possible to enable or disable emulation of the PET diagnostic pin
via the @code{DiagPin} resource, or the ``PET userport diagnostic pin''
item in the right-button menu.

When the diagnostic pin is set, the Kernal does not try to initialize

@node Colour PET
@subsection Colour PET
The Colour PET is a simple extension by Steve Gray
@uref{http://www.6502.org/users/sjgray/projects/colourpet/}. It exploits
the similarities and differences between the 4032 and 8032 models, to
use memory at $8800 as colour RAM.

There are two versions of the extension:

with digital colour (RGBI), which can select 16 foreground and 16
background colours for each character cell. The 8 colour bits are
used as RGBI RGBI, with the most significant bits for the background,
and the least significant bits for the foreground.

With analog colour, which can use 256 foreground colours for each
character cell, the 8 colour bits are used as RRR GGG BB.

@node PET colors
@subsection Changing screen colors

It is also possible to choose what color set is used for the emulation
window.  This is done by specifying a palette file name (@pxref{Palette
files}) in the @code{PaletteName} resource.  The menu provides the
following values:

@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{green.vpl} (default, ``green)''), the good old green-on-black
feeling;
@item
@code{amber.vpl} (``amber''), an amber phosphor lookalike;
@item
@code{white.vpl} (``white''), simple white-on-black palette.

@node PET DWW high resolution graphics

@subsection DWW high resolution graphics
@cindex DWW
The DWW, or Double-W
@footnote{Dubbel-W bord, designed by Ben de Winter and Pieter
Wolvekamp},
board is a high resolution graphics board for PET models 30xx. It
attaches to the internal expansion connector.  It would not physically
fit in 20xx, 40xx or 80xx models because their connectors are physically
and logically different. Apart from this, it requires address space at
$EC00-$EFFF, which makes it unfit to work in 40xx and 80xx models, which
have only 256 bytes of I/O space at $E800.

The DWW board consists of 8 KB of RAM and a PIA to control various
options. The RAM can be mapped either linearly at $9000-$AFFF,
or bank-switched in 8 banks of 8 KB each at $EC00-$EFFF.

It seems that in the demo programs, the BASIC versions like to
POKE in 60200, where the machine language programs use $EB00.
@verbatim
60200 Port A or DDR A           $EB28
$EBx0 1  0 \
      2  1 - RAM block at $EC00 (0-7)
      4  2 /
      8  3 charrom         0 = off 1 = on
      16 4 hires           0 = on  1 = off
      32 5 extra charrom   0 = on  1 = off

60201 Control Register A: bit #3 (worth 4) controls if 60200
$EBx1 accesses the Data Direction Register A (0) or Port A (1).

60202 Port B or DDR B
$EBx2 0 = RAM is visible from $9000 - $AFFF
      1 = RAM is bank-switched in blocks of 1 K in $EC00 - $EFFF

      [Control Register B is never mentioned, so putting 1 in this
       address would access the DDR, creating an output line, which
       after RESET is default 0...]
@end verbatim

Typical initialisation sequence:
@verbatim
    poke 60201,0        poke 60200,255          (all outputs)
    poke 60201,4        poke 60200,24 or 25 (16 + 8 + 1)
@end verbatim

Demo programs on disk PBE-110A, 110B, 111A, and 111B.
(PBE = PET Benelux Exchange, the Dutch PET user group)

The memory mapping is a bit strange. It seems each 1 K block contains
the pixeldata for 1 bit-line of each text line. This is probably so that
the addressing of the RAM can borrow part of the addressing
logic/signals of the text screen. (The screen addressing cycles through
0-39, then increases the line (= byte offset) which is fetched from
the character ROM; for the graphics, the screen position selects the
byte in a KB and the char ROM offset selects which KB of graphics RAM).

My notes say: to set a pixel:
@verbatim
RE = INT(Y/8): LY = Y - 8*RE    (or Y AND 7)
BY = INT(X/8): BI = X - 8*BY    (or X AND 7)
@end verbatim

when memory mapped to $9000:
@verbatim
    L = 36864 + 1024 * LY + 40 * RE + BY
    POKE L, PEEK(L) OR 2^BI
@end verbatim

when memory mapped to $EC00:
@verbatim
    POKE 60200,LY + 40 (or 8?)
    L = 60416 + RE * 40 + BY
    POKE L, PEEK(L) OR 2^BI
@end verbatim

Unfortunately there is no logical means of expanding the memory
to 16 K, so even in an 80 columns PET the resolution will be the same.

@node PET HRE (HiRes Emulator) high resolution graphics

@subsection HRE high resolution graphics

This information comes from @email{kontakt@@michau.name, Michal Pleban},
@uref{http://www.cbm-ii.com}.

@cindex HRE
This is a short information about the HRE (HiRes Emulator) graphics
board for PET 8296. This is a small board that is installed on the
mainboard into sockets for the CRTC and character ROM. It adds the
ability to display 512x256 graphics on the built-in monitor.

The board is accompanied with two extension ROMs:

@itemize
@item
324992-02 HiRes Emulator (at $9000)
@item
324993-02 HiRes BASIC (at $A000)
@end itemize

The ROMs are initialized by the command
@code{SYS 36864}.

@cindex HRG
After that, the computer recognizes additional BASIC commands like
DISPLAY, PLOT and so on; these commands are identical to those of the
HiRes Graphics boards based on Thomson chips. All BASIC programs written
for the HRG boards should also work on the HRE (albeit much slower).

Upon initialization, the ROM code writes some routines into expansion
RAM as $8800 - they are used to manipulate the bitmap data. The actual
bitmap is located in expansion RAM at addresses $A000-$DFFF, and is
organized linearly (first 64 bytes form the first display line, then
comes the next line and so on).

The RAM is accessed for reading by writing the value #$83 into $E888.
This is a register in the CRTC memory space that is intercepted by the
board and serves as a latch to drive jumpers on the 8296D mainboard.
Because the ROMs are banked out this way, all video memory manipulation
must happen with interrupts disabled. Normal ROM operation is restored
by writing #$0F into $E888.

As usual with the 8296, the RAM can also be written even when the ROMs
are mapped normally.

The board is initialized into graphics mode by modifying the following
values in CRTC registers (it is done by the routine located at $8C1A):

@itemize @bullet
@item
Register $01 (horizontal displayed) = #$20
@item
Register $02 (horizontal sync position) = original + #$02
@item
Register $06 (vertical displayed) = #$20
@item
Register $07 (vertical sync position) = original + #$04
@item
Register $0C (RAM address high) = #$02
@end itemize

The last value causes the board to switch into graphics mode; former values set up propoer screen dimensions for 512x256 display.

With @code{xcbm2} and @code{xcbm5x0}, it is possible to change at runtime the
characteristics of the emulated CBM so that it matches (or not) the ones
of a certain CBM model, and it is also possible to select from a common
set of CBM models so that all the features are selected accordingly.

The former is done by changing the following resources (via resource
file, command line options or right-menu items):

@table @code

@vindex RamSize
@item RamSize
Size of memory in kByte.
xcbm2: (128, 256, 512, 1024)

@vindex RamC
@item RamC
Boolean specifying whether the RAM should be mapped to the expansion ROM area at $C000-$CFFF or not.

@vindex CartridgeReset
@item CartridgeReset
Boolean specifying whether the machine should be reset when a cartridge is changed.

@vindex Cart6Name
@item Cart6Name
String specifying the filename for the $6000-$7FFF expansion ROM file. This file contains an 8k ROM dump.

@vindex ModelLine
@item ModelLine
The CBM-II business models have two hardcoded lines at one of the I/O ports.
From those lines the kernal determines how it should init the
CRTC video chip for either 50Hz (Europe) or 60Hz (North America),
and either for 8 (C6x0) or 14 (C7x0) scanlines per character.
xcbm2: (0: CBM 7x0 (50Hz), 1: 60Hz C6x0, 2: 50Hz C6x0)
xcbm5x0: (1: 60Hz C5x0, 2: 50Hz C5x0)

@vindex ChargenName
@item ChargenName
String specifying the name of the character generator ROM
(default for xcbm2: @file{chargen.600}, default for xcbm5x0: @file{chargen.500}).

@vindex KernalName
@item KernalName
String specifying the name of the Kernal ROM
(default for xcbm2: @file{kernal}, default for xcbm5x0: @file{kernal.500}).

@vindex BasicName
@item BasicName
String specifying the name of the Basic ROM
(default for xcbm2: @file{basic.128}, default for xcbm5x0: @file{basic.500}).

@vindex MachineVideoStandard
@item MachineVideoStandard
@c will be 'fixed' for xcbm2 later, for now xcbm5x0 only
Integer that specifies the video standard of the emulated machine
(1: PAL, 2: NTSC).

@end table

Choosing a common CBM-II model is done from the right-button menu instead,
by choosing an item from the ``Model defaults'' submenu.  Available
models are:

@itemize @bullet
@item
C510 PAL or NTSC (128k RAM)
@item
C610 PAL or NTSC (128k RAM)
@item
C620 (256k RAM)
@item
C620+ (1024k RAM, expanded) PAL or NTSC
@item
C710 (128k RAM) NTSC
@item
C720 (256k RAM) NTSC
@item
C720+ (1024k RAM, expanded) NTSC
@end itemize

Notice that this will @strong{reset the emulated machine}.

@b{Warning:} At this time the 5x0 and other machines are implemented
in different executables, so switching between those models is not possible.

It is also possible to select the CBM model at startup, with the
@code{-model} command-line option: for example, @samp{xcbm2 -model 610}
will emulate a CBM 610 while @samp{xcbm2 -model 620} will emulate a CBM
620.

@chapter Snapshots

Every VICE emulator has a built-in snapshot feature, that saves the
complete emulator state into one file for later use.
You can therefore save the emulator state - including the state of
the game you are playing for example - in a single file.

@menu
* Snapshot usage::
* Snapshot format::
@end menu

@node Snapshot usage, Snapshot format, Snapshots, Snapshots
@section Snapshot usage

A snapshot is one file containining the complete emulator state.  A
snapshot file can be generated by selecting the ``Save snapshot''
command at any time.  This will pop up a requester from which you can
specify whether the snapshot should also contain the disk and ROM
status.

A snapshot file can be used to restore the emulator state by selecting
the @code{load snapshot} menu entry at any time.
Unfortunately attached ROM images/cartridges are only supported in the VIC20,
the PET and the CBM-II emulators at this time.

The memory configuration of the emulator is saved in the snapshot file as
well. This configuration is restored when the snapshot is loaded.

A quick snapshot can now be made by pressing the @code{M-F11} key and
reloaded by pressing the @code{M-F10} key.

@node Snapshot format,  , Snapshot usage, Snapshots
@section Snapshot format

A snapshot file consists of several modules of mostly different types.
Each module has a name and saves the state of an entity like a CIA, the CPU,
or the memory.

The single chip modules contain the @b{chip} state, not the state of the

possible, to allow reuse of snapshots in later versions of this
emulator, or even in other emulators.

The file header is followed by a number of different snapshot modules.

Each module has a header with the information given in the table below.
The header includes two version numbers, VMAJOR and VMINOR.  Modules
with the same VMAJOR should be able to be exchanged.  I.e. higher VMINOR
numbers only append to the data for lower VMINOR.  This additional data
is ignored by older restore routines.  The other way around newer
restore routines must accept the fewer info from lower VMINOR dumps.
Changes in VMAJOR might introduce any incompatibility you like, but
that's what VMAJOR is for after all :-)

The PIA 6520 is a chip with two I/O ports (Parallel Interface Adapter)
and four additional handshake lines.  The chip is pretty the same for
Port A and B, only that Port A implements handshake on read operation
and port B on write operation.

The TPI 6525 is a chip with three I/O ports (Tri-Port-Interface).  One of
the ports can double as an interrupt prioritizer.  Therefore we also have
to save the states of the interrupt stack etc.

@subsubsection ACIA module

The ACIA 6551 is an RS232 interface chip.  VICE emulates RS232 connections
via @code{/dev/ttyS*} (Unix) or @code{COM:} (DOS/WIN - not yet?).
When saving a snapshot, those connections are of course lost.
The state of the ACIA however is restored if possible.  I.e. if a connection
is already open when restoring the snapshot, this connection is used
instead.  If no connection is open, a carrier/DTR drop is emulated.

@b{Warning:} After VICE version 1.0 the CRTC emulation has improved
considerably. Especially it is now cycle exact. Therefore a lot more
variables must be saved. The snapshot module version jumped from
0.0 to 1.0. Newer versions of VICE can read the old snapshots, but
older versions (1.0 and below) cannot read the new snapshots.

@b{Warning:} This module is still under construction.  Especially the
RASTERY and RASTERLINE values might be bogus.

The RAM* arrays are only saved if the RAM itself is less than 1M.
If the memory size is 1M then those areas are taken from the

@chapter Event history

@c FIXME: the "Event history" section needs to be style-checked.

VICE supports recording an arbitrary session on the emulated machine and
playing back this session later. This is done by saving a snapshot at the beginning
of the recording session and then remembering all the user interaction such as
keyboard and joystick input. We call this an 'event history'.
The main purpose for having an event history is to create game sessions, e.g. recording
how to solve a game. An example walkthrough for the well known game "Fort Apocalypse" is
available.

This brief chapter will advise you how to record and playback such a session.
Although it is based on the WinVICE x64 release and its user interface, histories may be
transferred to other machines and other ports that support event history, e.g. the
Unix port.

@c @node FIXME
@section Recommended Settings

When using the event history feature it is possible that the playback session
differs from what was done at recording time. This might arise due to a problem
in the initial snapshot or settings.
Here are some suggestions to minimize the chance of failures in the session:
a. Reset to default settings.
b. Choose refresh rate 1/1.
c. Choose joystick and Video/Doublesize settings as desired or needed.
d. SID engine must be reSID (which is the default).
e. Choose Drive settings/Idle method: None
Do not change any settings during recording or playback!

@c @node FIXME
@section Recorded Events

The following is a list of the user interaction that will be recorded:
- Joystick movement and button
- Keyboard
- Resetting the machine (hard and soft)
- Attaching or detaching disk/tape images (see 8. Limitations)
- Datasette controls

@c @node FIXME
@section Recording an Event History

Recording an event history will create one or two files for a snapshot and
the list of the user events. First, create an empty directory in which these
files are to be saved and then select this directory and the name of the
snapshot files via 'Snapshot//Select History files/directory'.
Next, attach the disk or tape image with the game you want to record and load and
run the game.

Start recording via 'Snapshot//Start/Stop Recording History'.
Play the game. All actions will be recorded.
After the game is finished, stop recording via 'Snapshot//Start/Stop
Recording History'. The selected directory should now contain the two
snapshot files (default ist start.vsf and end.vsf).

@c @node FIXME
@section Setting and Returning to Milestones

It is difficult to finish a game in one sitting and noone wants to
record all their mistakes and lost lives. Use the milestone feature in a
recording session in the following way:

Set a milestone when you have finished a level or completed a task
('Snapshot//Set recording milestone' or ALT-E). This will save the event
history and a snapshot of the machine to the file end.vsf but recording will
continue.

Return to the last milestone when you have made a mistake or lost a life
('Snapshot//Return to milestone' or ALT-U). This will reset the game and the
event history to the last milestone snapshot so that you can try again.

@c @node FIXME
@section Continuing an Event History

If you have stopped a recording session and want to continue it later, you
should create a backup of your start.vsf and end.vsf files first to avoid
overwriting them by accident.

Then change the event history start mode: 'Snapshot//Recording start mode//Load
existing snapshot'. When you start recording now, you will continue where the
session was stopped last time.

Another way of continuing an existing history is to start somewhere inside the
history (e.g. you have recorded 10 minutes of a game and later recognize that you
made a mistake after 6 minutes that makes it impossible to finish the game).
For this you have to select the start mode 'Overwrite playback'. Now you can
start the playback with 'Snapshot//Start/Stop Playback History' and when you
reach the point where you want to change the history you can directly switch to
recording via 'Snapshot//Start/Stop Recording History'.

@c @node FIXME
@section Playing Back an Event History

To play back an event history, select the directory with the history files
start.vsf and end.vsf via 'Snapshot//Select History directory' and start the
playback with 'Snapshot//Start/Stop Playback History'. Enjoy!
During playback any user interaction is disabled.
The playback stops when the end of the session is reached or if
'Snapshot//Select History directory' is selected again.

@c @node FIXME
@section Limitations and Suggestions

a. Snapshot files will be quite big (>1MB) if a disk image has been attached.
If possible, use PRG or T64 images to reduce the size of snapshot files.
b. Snapshots may not be 100% accurate even with all the recommended settings.

@chapter Monitor

Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be used
to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as
well as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using
the ``Activate monitor'' command (left button menu).  Notice that in some
ports you have to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program (such as
@code{rxvt} or @code{xterm}) in order to use the monitor.

@table @samp

@item address_space
This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of registers.
This can be the addresses available to the computer's processor, the
disk drive's processor or a specific memory configuration of one of
the mentioned processors.

@item bankname
The CPU can only see 64k of memory at any one time, due to its 16 bit
address bus. The C64 and other computers have more than this amount,
and this is handled by banking: a memory address can have different
contents, depending on the active memory bank.
A bankname names a specific bank in the current address_space.

@item register
One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

@item address
A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

@item address_range
Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the
range is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both addresses
must be in the same address space.

@item address_opt_range
An address or an address range.

@item label
@code{label} is the name of a label. It must start with a dot (".")
in order for the monitor to recognize it as a label. Register names preceeded
by a dot (for example @code{.PC}) are special labels that evaluate to value of
the respective register at the time it is used, and thus can not be used as
a regular label.

@item prompt
The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S.  The second part
of the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

@item checkpoint
The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an action
when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types of
checkpoints; breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

@item breakpoint
A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
triggered, the monitor is entered.

@item tracepoint
Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
printed and execution continues.

@item watchpoint
Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.  When
a watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

@item memmap
The memmap keeps track of RAM/ROM/IO read/write/execute
accesses. The feature must be enabled with "--enable-cpuhistory"
configure option, as it might decrease performance notably on
slower hardware. The option also enables CPU history.

@item <@dots{}>
A data type.

@item *
Zero or more occurrences.

@item [@dots{}]
An optional argument.

'dot' address is used.

@item memmapshow [<mask>] [<address_opt_range>]
@itemx mmsh [<mask>] [<address_opt_range>]
Show the memmap. The mask can be specified to show only those
locations with accesses of certain type(s). The mask is a number

@item sidefx [on|off|toggle]
@itemx sfx [on|off|toggle]
Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that have
read side-effects, like CIA interrupt registers for example.
If the argument is 'on' then reads may cause side-effects.  If the
argument is 'off' then reads don't cause side-effects.  If the
argument is 'toggle' then the current mode is switched.  No argument
displays the current state.

@table @code

@item break [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]
This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid checkpoints
are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is set for that
address and the breakpoint number is printed.
The "load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or "exec"
(or any combination of these) to determine on which operation the
monitor breaks. If not specified, the monitor breaks on "exec".
A conditional expression can also be specified for the breakpoint.
For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

@item enable <checknum>
@item disable <checknum>
Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows
changing between these states.

@item command <checknum> "<command>"
When checkpoint @code{checknum} is hit, the specified command is
executed by the monitor.  Note that the @code{x} command is not yet
supported as a command argument.

@item condition <checknum> if <cond_expr>
@itemx cond <checknum> if <cond_expr>
Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
Otherwise, it is ignored.  If registers are specified in the
expression, the values used are those at the time the checkpoint is
examined, not when the condition is set.

Currently, the cond_expr is very limited. You can use registers (.A, .X,
.Y, .PC, and .SP) and compare against other registers or absolute
values. For example, the following are all valid conditions:
.A == 0, .X == .Y, 8:.X == .X, .A != 5, .A < .X.

However, you cannot specify memory contents and compare that.


@item delete <checknum>
@itemx del <checknum>
Delete the specified checkpoint.

@item ignore <checknum> [<count>]
Ignore a checkpoint after a given number of crossings.  If no count is
given, the default value is 1.

@item trace [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]
@itemx tr [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]
This command is similar to the @code{break} command except that it
operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint by
not stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the user an
execution trace.  The second optional address can be used to specify
the end of an range of addresses to be traced.
If no addresses are given, a list of all the checkpoints is printed.
The "load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or "exec"
(or any combination of these) to determine which operation the
monitor traces. If not specified, the monitor traces all operations.
A conditional expression can also be specified for the tracepoint.
For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

@item until [<address>]
@itemx un [<address>]
If no address is given, the currently valid breakpoints are printed.
If an address is given, a temporary breakpoint is set for that address
and the breakpoint number is printed.  Control is returned to the
emulator by this command.  The breakpoint is deleted once it is hit.

@item watch [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]
@itemx w [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]
This command is similar to the @code{break} command except that it
operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from a breakpoint by
stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of addresses.
If no addresses are given, a list of all the checkpoints is printed.
The "load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or "exec"
(or any combination of these) to determine on which operation the
monitor breaks. If not specified, the monitor breaks on "load" and
"store" operations.
A conditional expression can also be specified for the watchpoint.
For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

@table @code

@item add_label <address> <label>
@itemx al <address> <label>
Map a given address to a label.  This label can be used when entering
assembly code and is shown during disassembly.  Additionally, it can
be used whenever an address must be specified.

<label> is the name of the label; it must start with a dot (".") in
order for the monitor to recognize it as a label.

@item delete_label [<address_space>] <label>
@itemx dl [<address_space>] <label>
Remove the specified label from the label tables.  If no address space is
checked, all tables are checked.

@item load_labels [<address_space>] "<filename>"
@itemx ll [<address_space>] "<filename>"
Load a file containing a mapping of labels to addresses.  If no address
space is specified, the default readspace is used.

The file must contain commands the monitor understands, e.g. add_label. The
compiler cc65 can create such label files.

Vice can also load label files created by the Acme assembler. Their syntax is
e.g. "labelname = $1234 ; Maybe a comment". A dot will be added automatically
to label names assigned in this way to fit to the Vice label syntax. Normally
the semicolon seperates commands but after an assignment of this kind it may be
used to start a comment to end of line, so unchanged Acme label files can be
fed into Vice.

@item save_labels [<address_space>] "<filename>"
@itemx sl [<address_space>] "<filename>"
Save labels to a file.  If no address space is specified, all of the
labels are saved.

@item show_labels [<address_space>]
@itemx shl [<address_space>]
Display current label mappings.  If no address space is specified, show
all labels from default address space.

@item clear_labels [<address_space>]

@chapter c1541

VICE is provided with a complete stand-alone disk image maintenance
utility, called @code{c1541}.

You can either invoke it from the command
line or from within one of the VICE emulators, using the ``Run c1541''
menu item which will open a new terminal window with a running
@code{c1541} in it.

The syntax is:

@example
c1541 [IMAGE1 [IMAGE2]] [COMMAND1 COMMAND2 @dots{} COMMANDN]
@end example

@code{IMAGE1} and @code{IMAGE2} are disk image names that can be
attached before @code{c1541} starts.  @code{c1541} can handle up to
two disk images at the same time by using two virtual built-in drives,
numbered @code{8} and @code{9}; @code{IMAGE1} (if present) is always
attached to drive @code{8}, while @code{IMAGE2} is attached to drive
@code{9}.

@code{COMMAND}s specified on the command-line all begin with the minus
sign (@code{-}); if present, @code{c1541} executes them in the same
order as they are on the command line and returns a zero error code if
they were successful.  If any of the @code{COMMAND}s fails, @code{c1541}
stops and returns a nonzero error code.

If no @code{COMMAND}s are specified at all, @code{c1541} enters
interactive mode, where you can type commands manually.  Commands in
interactive mode are the same as commands in batch mode, but do not
require a leading @code{-}.  As with the monitor, file name completion
and command line editing with history are provided via GNU
@code{readline}.  Use the command @samp{quit} or press @kbd{C-d} to
exit.

@section Specifying files in c1541

When accessing CBM DOS files (i.e. files that reside on disk images),
c1541 uses a special syntax that lets you access files on both drive 8
and 9.  If you prepend the file name with @code{@@8:} or @code{@@9:}, you
will specified that file is to be found or created on drive 8 and 9,
respectively.

For instance,

@example
@@8:somefile
@end example

will name file named @code{somefile} on unit 8, while

@example
@@9:somefile
@end example

will name file named @code{somefile} on unit 9.

@node c1541 quoting, c1541 commands and options, c1541 file specification, c1541
@section Using quotes and backslashes

You can use quotes (@code{"}) in a command to embed spaces into file
names.  For instance,

@example
read some file
@end example

will read file @code{some} from the disk image and write it into the
file system as @code{file}, while

@example
read "some file"
@end example

will copy @code{some file} into the file system, with the name
@code{some file}.

The backslash character (@code{\}) has a special meaning too: it lets
you literally insert the following character no matter what it is.  For
example,

@example
read some\ file
@end example

will copy file @code{some file} into the file system, while

@example
read some\ file this\"file
@end example

will copy @code{some file} into the file system with name
@code{this"file} (with an embedded quote).

@section The G64 GCR-encoded disk image format
@subsection The original format

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Ettore Perazzoli.)

This format was defined in 1998 as a cooperative effort between several
emulator people, mainly Per Håkan Sundell, author of the CCS64 C64
emulator, Andreas Boose of the VICE CBM emulator team and Joe
Forster/STA, the author of Star Commander.  It was the first real public
attempt to create a format for the emulator community which removed
almost all of the drawbacks of the other existing image formats, namely
@code{D64}.

The intention behind @code{G64} is not to replace the widely used
@code{D64} format, as @code{D64} works fine with the vast majority of
disks in existence.  It is intended for those small percentage of
programs which demand to work with the 1541 drive in a non-standard way,
such as reading or writing data in a custom format.  The best example is
with speeder software such as Action Cartridge in Warp Save mode or
Vorpal which write track/sector data in another format other than
standard GCR.  The other obvious example is copy-protected software
which looks for some specific data on a track, like the disk ID, which
is not stored in a standard @code{D64} image.

@code{G64} has a deceptively simply layout for what it is capable of
doing.  We have a signature, version byte, some predefined size values,
and a series of offsets to the track data and speed zones.  It is what's
contained in the track data areas and speed zones which is really at the
heart of this format.

Each track entry in simply the raw stream of GCR data, just what a read
head would see when a diskette is rotating past it.  How the data gets
interpreted is up to the program trying to access the disk.  Because the
data is stored in such a low-level manner, just about anything can be
done.  Most of the time I would suspect the data in the track would be
standard sectors, with SYNC, GAP, header, data and checksums.  The
arrangement of the data when it is in a standard GCR sector layout is
beyond the scope of this document.

Since it is a flexible format in both track count and track byte size,
there is no ``standard'' file size.  However, given a few constants like
42 tracks and halftracks, a track size of 7928 bytes and no speed offset
entries, the typical file size will a minimum of 333744 bytes.

Below is a dump of the header, broken down into its various parts.
After that will be an explanation of the track offset and speed zone
offset areas, as they demand much more explanation.

@example
Addr  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
----  -----------------------------------------------

@item $0008

@item $000A-000B
@tab Size of each stored track in bytes (usually 7928, or $1EF8) in LO/HI format.
@end multitable

An obvious question here is ``why are there 84 tracks defined when a
normal @code{D64} disk only has 35 tracks?''  Well, by definition, this
image includes all half-tracks, so there are actually 42 tracks and 42
half tracks.  The 1541 stepper motor can access up to 42 tracks and the
in-between half-tracks.  Even though using more than 35 tracks is not
typical, it was important to define this format from the start with what
the 1541 is capable of doing, and not just what it typically does.

At first, the defined track size value of 7928 bytes may seem to be
arbitrary, but it is not.  It is determined by the fastest write speed
possible (speed zone 0), coupled with the average rotation speed of the
disk (300 rpm).  After some math, the answer that actually comes up is
7692 bytes.  Why the discrepency between the actual size of 7692 and the
defined size of 7928? Simply put, not all drives rotate at 300 rpm.
Some can be faster or slower, so a upper safety margin of +3% was built
added, in case some disks rotate slower and can write more data.  After
applying this safety factor, and some rounding-up, 7928 bytes per track
was arrived at.

Also note that this upper limit of 7928 bytes per track really only
applies to 1541 and compatible disks.  If this format were applied to
another disk type like the SFD1001, this value would be higher.

Below is a dump of the first section of a @code{G64} file, showing the offsets
to the data portion for each track and half-track entry. Following that
is a dump of the speed zone offsets.

Starting here at $02AC is the first track entry (from above, it is the

The track offsets (from above) require some explanation.  When one is
set to all 0's, no track data exists for this entry.  If there is a
value, it is an absolute reference into the file (starting from the

Following the track data is filler bytes.  In this case, there are 368
bytes of unused space.  This space can contain anything, but for the
sake of those wishing to compress these images for storage, they should
all be set to the same value.  In the sample I used, these are all set
to $FF.

@end example

The speed offset entries can be a little more complex. The 1541 has four
speed zones defined, which means the drive can write data at four
distinct speeds.  On a normal 1541 disk, these zones are as follows:

@multitable @columnfractions .5 .5
@item @b{Track Range}
@tab @b{Speed Zone}
@item 1-17
@tab 3  (highest writing speed)
@item 18-24
@tab 2
@item 25-30
@tab 1
@item 31 and up
@tab 0 (lowest writing speed)
@end multitable

Note that you can, through custom programming of the 1541, change the
speed zone of any track to something different (change the 3 to a 0) and
write data differently.  From the dump of the speed offset entries
above, we see that all the entries are in the range of 0-3. If any entry
is less than 4, this is not considered a speed offset but defines the
whole track to be recorded at that one speed.

In the example I had, there were no offsets defined, so no speed zone
dump can be shown.  However, I can define what should be there.  You
will have a block of data, 1982 bytes long.  Each byte is encoded to
represent the speed of 4 bytes in the track offset area, and is broken
down as follows:

@example
Speed entry $FF:  in binary %11111111
                             |'|'|'|'
                             | | | |
                             | | | +- 4'th byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
                             | | +--- 3'rd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
                             | +----- 2'nd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
                             +------- 1'st byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
@end example

It was very smart thinking to allow for two speed zone settings, one in
the offset block and another defining the speed on a per-byte basis.  If
you are working with a normal disk, where each track is one constant
speed, then you don't need the extra blocks of information hanging
around the image, wasting space.

What may not be obvious is the flexibility of this format to add tracks
and speed offset zones at will.  If a program decides to write a track
out with varying speeds, and no speed offset exist, a new block will be
created by appending it to the end of the image, and the offset pointer
for that track set to point to the new block.  If a track has no offset
yet, meaning it doesn't exist (like a half-track), and one needs to be
added, the same procedure applies.  The location of the actual track or
speed zone data is not important, meaning they do not have to be in any
particular order since they are all referenced by the offsets at the
beginning of the image.

@subsection An extension for double sided disks (Commodore VIC 1571)

Given that a Commodore VIC 1541/1570/1571 can read/write at most 42
tracks per side, it is quite natural to use the half-tracks from 1
to 84 for the first side and the following 84 half-tracks (i. e.
halg.track 85 to 168) for the second size.

In order for this to work, byte 9 of the image (i. e. the maximum
number of tracks) usually contains 168 for double sided disks.

To make identifying such images easy, the fiel signature in the first 8 bytes of
such files will be @code{GCR-1571}).

@end example

All initial model state values are initialized with zero.

All initial model probability values are initialized with 2048.

These model probability values will be updating in a adaptive way on the
fly and not precalculated before the encoding and even not loaded before
the decoding, see pseudo code below.

16000000 Hz / 5 rotations per second at 300 RPM = maximal 3200000 flux pulses

So NRZI transition flux pulse positions are in the 0 .. 3199999 value range,
which is also a exact single rotation, where each time unit is a cycle at
16 MHz with 300 RPM as a mapping for the ideal case.

The NRZI transition flux pulse stength are in the 0x00000000 .. 0xffffffff
value range, where 0xffffffff indices a strong flux pulse, that always
triggers, and 0x00000001 indices a weak flux pulse, that almost never
triggers, and 0x00000000 indices a flux pulse, that absolutly never
triggers.

For 32-bit values, the model sub streams are subdivided byte wide in a
little-endian manner, and each byte is processed bitwise with model
probability shifting of 4 bits, just as:

Pascal-Style pseudo code:
@example
procedure WriteDWord(Model, Value : longword);
var ByteValue, ByteIndex, Context, Bit : longword;
begin
  for ByteIndex := 0 to 3 do begin
    ByteValue := (Value shr (ByteIndex shl 3)) and $ff;
    Context := 1;
    for Bit := 7 downto 0 do begin
      Context := (Context shl 1) or RangeCoderEncodeBit(
                    RangeCoderProbabilities[
                     RangeCoderProbabilityOffsets[Model + ByteIndex] +
                     (((RangeCoderProbabilityStates[Model + ByteIndex]
                     shl 8) or Context) and $ffff)], 4, (ByteValue shr
                     Bit) and 1);
    end;
    RangeCoderProbabilityStates[Model+ByteIndex] := ByteValue;
  end;
end;
@end example

And for 1-bit flag values it is much simpler, but also with model probability
shifting of 4 bits, just as:

Pascal-Style pseudo code:
@example
procedure WriteBit(Model, Value : longword);
begin
   RangeCoderProbabilityStates[Model] :=
     RangeCoderEncodeBit(RangeCoderProbabilities[
       RangeCoderProbabilityOffsets[Model] +
         RangeCoderProbabilityStates[Model]], 4, Value and 1);
end;
@end example

The position and strength values are delta-encoded. If a value is equal to
the last previous value, then the value will not encoded, instead, a flag for
this will encoded. First the position value will encoded, then the stength
value. If the last position delta is 0, then it is a track stream end marker.

Pascal-Style pseudo code:
@example
LastPosition := 0;
PreviousDeltaPosition := 0

LastStrength := 0;

for PulseIndex := 0 to PulseCount - 1 do begin

  DeltaPosition := Pulses[PulseIndex].Position - LastPosition;
  if PreviousDeltaPosition <> DeltaPosition then begin
    PreviousDeltaPosition := DeltaPosition;
    WriteBit(ModelPositionFlag, 1)
    WriteDWord(ModelPosition, DeltaPosition);
  end else begin
    WriteBit(ModelPositionFlag, 0);
  end;
  LastPosition := Pulses[PulseIndex].Position;

  if LastStrength <> Pulses[PulseIndex].Strength then begin
    WriteBit(ModelStrengthFlag, 1)
    WriteDWord(ModelStrength, Pulses[PulseIndex].Strength - LastStrength);
  end else begin
    WriteBit(ModelStrengthFlag, 0);
  end;
  LastStrength := Pulses^[PulseIndex].Strength;

end;

// End code
WriteBit(ModelPositionFlag, 1);
WriteDWord(ModelPosition, 0);
@end example

The decoding is simply just in the another direction way.

Pseudo code for a FPAQ0-style carryless range coder:

Pascal-Style pseudo code:
@example
procedure RangeCoderInit; // At encoding and decoding start
begin
  RangeCode := 0;
  RangeLow := 0;
  RangeHigh := $ffffffff;
end;

procedure RangeCoderStart; // At decoding start
var Counter : longword;
begin
  for Counter := 1 to 4 do begin
   RangeCode := (RangeCode shl 8) or ReadByteFromInput;
  end;
end;

procedure RangeCoderFlush; // At encoding end
var Counter : longword;
begin
  for Counter := 1 to 4 do begin
    WriteByteToOutput(RangeHigh shr 24);
    RangeHigh := RangeHigh shl 8;
  end;
end;

procedure RangeCoderEncodeNormalize;
begin
  while ((RangeLow xor RangeHigh) and $ff000000) = 0 do begin
   WriteByteToOutput(RangeHigh shr 24);
   RangeLow := RangeLow shl 8;
   RangeHigh := (RangeHigh shl 8) or $ff;
  end;
end;

function RangeCoderEncodeBit(var Probability : longword; Shift,
                             BitValue : longword) : longword;
begin
  RangeMiddle := RangeLow + (((RangeHigh - RangeLow) shr 12) *
                              Probability);
  if BitValue <> 0 then begin
    inc(Probability, ($fff - Probability) shr Shift);
    RangeHigh := RangeMiddle;
  end else begin
    dec(Probability, Probability shr Shift);
    RangeLow := RangeMiddle + 1;
  end;
  RangeCoderEncodeNormalize;
  result := BitValue;
end;

procedure RangeCoderDecodeNormalize;
begin
  while ((RangeLow xor RangeHigh) and $ff000000) = 0 do begin
    RangeLow := RangeLow shl 8;
    RangeHigh := (RangeHigh shl 8) or $ff;
    RangeCode := (RangeCode shl 8) or ReadByteFromInput;
  end;
end;

function RangeCoderDecodeBit(var Probability : longword;
                             Shift : longword) : longword;
begin
  RangeMiddle := RangeLow + (((RangeHigh - RangeLow) shr 12) *
                             Probability);
  if RangeCode <= RangeMiddle then begin
    inc(Probability, ($fff - Probability) shr Shift);
    RangeHigh := RangeMiddle;
    result := 1;
  end else begin
    dec(Probability, Probability shr Shift);
    RangeLow := RangeMiddle + 1;
    result := 0;
  end;
  RangeCoderDecodeNormalize;
end;
@end example

The probability may be never zero! But that can't happen here with this
adaptive model in this P64 file format, since the adaptive model uses a
shift factor of 4 bits and initial probabilities value of 2048, so the
probability has a value range from 15 up to 4080 here. If you do want to use
the above range coder routines for other stuff with other probability models,
then you must to ensure that the probability output value is never zero, for
example with  "probability |= (probability < 1); " in C.

@section The D64 disk image format

@c FIXME: the D64 section needs to be style-checked.

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel. Added 42 track info by groepaz)

First and foremost we have D64, which is basically a sector-for-sector
copy of a 1540/1541 disk. There are several versions of these which I
will cover shortly. The standard D64 is a 174848 byte file comprised
of 256 byte sectors arranged in 35 tracks with a varying number of
sectors per track for a total of 683 sectors. Track counting starts at
1, not 0, and goes up to 35. Sector counting starts at 0, not 1, for
the first sector, therefore a track with 21 sectors will go from 0 to 20.

The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in circles,
with track 1 on the very outside of the disk (closest to the sides) to
track 35 being on the inside of the disk (closest to the inner hub ring).
Commodore, in their infinite wisdom, varied the number of sectors per
track and data densities across the disk to optimize available storage,
resulting in the chart below. It shows the sectors/track for a standard
D64. Since the outside diameter of a circle is the largest (versus closer
to the center), the outside tracks have the largest amount of storage.

(*) Tracks 36-40 apply to 40- and 42-track images only.
(*) Tracks 41-42 apply to 42-track images only.

The directory track should be contained totally on track 18. Sectors
1-18 contain the entries and sector 0 contains the BAM
(Block Availability Map) and disk name/ID. Since the directory is
only 18 sectors large (19 less one for the BAM), and each sector can
contain only 8 entries (32 bytes per entry), the maximum number of
directory entries is 18 * 8 = 144. The first directory sector is
always 18/1, even though the t/s pointer at 18/0 (first two bytes)
might point somewhere else. It then follows the same chain structure
as a normal file, using a sector interleave of 3. This makes the
chain links go 18/1, 18/4, 18/7 etc.

Note that you can extend the directory off of track 18, but only
when reading the disk or image. Attempting to write to a directory
sector not on track 18 will cause directory corruption. Each
directory sector has the following layout (18/1 partial dump):

@example
 00: 12 04 81 11 00 4E 41 4D 45 53 20 26 20 50 4F 53 <- notice the T/S link
 10: 49 54 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 15 00 <- to 18/4 ($12/$04)
 20: 00 00 84 11 02 41 44 44 49 54 49 4F 4E 41 4C 20 <- and how its not here
 30: 49 4E 46 4F A0 11 0C FE 00 00 00 00 00 00 61 01 <- ($00/$00)
@end example

The first two bytes of the sector ($12/$04) indicate the location of
the next track/sector of the directory (18/4). If the track is set
to $00, then it is the last sector of the directory. It is possible,
however unlikely, that the directory may *not* be competely on track
18 (some disks do exist like this). Just follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00. The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter. The drive will return
all the available entries anyways.

This is a breakdown of a standard directory sector:

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange
results. The 1541 is inconsistent in how it treats these bits.
Some routines use all 4 bits, others ignore bit 3, resulting in
values from 0-7.

Files, on a standard 1541, are stored using an interleave of 10.
Assuming a starting track/sector of 17/0, the chain would run
17/0, 17/10, 17/20, 17/8, 17/18, etc.

directory track where all filenames are stored. This limits the
number of files stored on a disk based on the number of sectors
on the directory track. There are some disk images that contain
more files than would normally be allowed. This requires extending
the directory off the default directory track by changing the last
directory sector pointer to a new track, allocating the new
sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or moving existing) file
entries there. The directory of an extended disk can be read and
the files that reside there can be loaded without problems on a
real drive. However, this is still a very dangerous practice as
writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part. Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory
is on and assume the default directory track for operations.

To explain: assume that the directory has been extended from track
18 to track 19/6 and that the directory is full except for a few
slots on 19/6. When saving a new file, the drive DOS will find an
empty file slot at 19/6 offset $40 and correctly write the filename
and a few other things into this slot. When the file is done being
saved the final file information will be written to 18/6 offset $40
instead of 19/6 causing some directory corruption to the entry at
18/6. Also, the BAM entries for the sectors occupied by the new
file will not be saved and the new file will be left as a SPLAT (*)
file.

Attempts to validate the disk will result in those files residing
off the directory track to not be allocated in the BAM, and could
also send the drive into an endless loop. The default directory
track is assumed for all sector reads when validating so if the
directory goes to 19/6, then the validate code will read 18/6
instead. If 18/6 is part of the normal directory chain then the
validate routine will loop endlessly.

@end multitable

Note: The BAM entries for SPEED, DOLPHIN and ProLogic DOS use
the same layout as standard BAM entries. One of the interesting
things from the BAM sector is the byte at offset $02, the DOS
version byte. If it is set to anything other than $41 or $00,
then we have what is called "soft write protection". Any attempt
to write to the disk will return the "DOS Version" error code
73 ,"CBM DOS V 2.6 1541". The 1541 is simply telling you that it
thinks the disk format version is incorrect. This message will
normally come up when you first turn on the 1541 and read the
error channel. If you write a $00 or a $41 into 1541 memory
location $00FF (for device 0), then you can circumvent this type
of write-protection, and change the DOS version back to what it
should be.

The BAM entries require a bit (no pun intended) more of a
breakdown. Take the first entry at bytes $04-$07 ($12 $FF $F9 $17).
The first byte ($12) is the number of free sectors on that track.
Since we are looking at the track 1 entry, this means it has 18
(decimal) free sectors. The next three bytes represent the bitmap
of which sectors are used/free. Since it is 3 bytes (8 bits/byte)
we have 24 bits of storage. Remember that at most, each track only
has 21 sectors, so there are a few unused bits.

These entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense. We will
use the first entry (track 1) at bytes 04-07:

@example
 FF=11111111, F9=11111001, 17=00010111
@end example

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the
bits around.

@example
            111111 11112222
 01234567 89012345 67890123
 --------------------------
 11111111 10011111 11101000
 ^                     ^
 sector 0           sector 20
@end example

Since we are on the first track, we have 21 sectors, and only
use up to the bit 20 position. If a bit is on (1), the sector
is free. Therefore, track 1 has sectors 9, 10 and 19 used,
all the rest are free. Any leftover bits that refer to
sectors that don't exist, like bits 21-23 in the above
example, are set to allocated.

Each filetype has its own unique properties, but most follow
one simple structure. The first file sector is pointed to by
the directory and follows a t/s chain, until the track value
reaches $00. When this happens, the value in the sector link
location indicates how much of the sector is used. For
example, the following chain indicates a file 6 sectors
long, and ends when we encounter the $00/$34 chain. At this
point the last sector occupies from bytes $02-$34.

@subsection Variations on the D64 layout

These are some variations of the D64 layout:

1. Standard 35 track layout but with 683 error bytes added on
to the end of the file. Each byte of the error info
corresponds to a single sector stored in the D64, indicating
if the sector on the original disk contained an error. The
first byte is for track 1/0, and the last byte is for track
35/16.

2. A 40 track layout, following the same layout as a 35 track
disk, but with 5 extra tracks. These contain 17 sectors each,
like tracks 31-35. Some of the PC utilities do allow you to
create and work with these files. This can also have error
bytes attached like variant #1.

3. A 42 track layout, with two extra tracks of 17 sectors each.
This is extremely uncommon, since real drives often have problems
with accessing these tracks, software that uses them is very rare.

4. The Commodore 128 allowed for "auto-boot" disks. With this,
t/s 1/0 holds a specific byte sequence which the computer
recognizes as boot code.

Below is a small chart detailing the standard file sizes of
D64 images, 35, 40 or 42 tracks, with or without error bytes.

*Note: There are also clones of SpeedDOS that exist, such as
RoloDOS and DigiDOS. Both are just a change of the DOS startup
string.

The location of the extra BAM information in sector 18/0, for
40 track images, will be different depending on what standard
the disks have been formatted with. SPEED DOS stores them from
$C0 to $D3, DOLPHIN DOS stores them from $AC to $BF and
PrologicDOS stored them right after the existing BAM entries
from $90-A3. PrologicDOS also moves the disk label and ID
forward from the standard location of $90 to $A4. 64COPY and
Star Commander let you select from several different types of
extended disk formats you want to create/work with.

All three of the speeder DOS's mentioned above don't alter the
standard sector interleave of 10 for files and 3 for
directories. The reason is that they use a memory cache
installed in the drive which reads the entire track in one
pass. This alleviates the need for custom interleave values.
They do seem to alter the algorithm that finds the next
available free sector so that the interleave value can deviate
from 10 under certain circumstances, but I don't know why they
would bother.

Below is a HEX dump of a Speed DOS BAM sector. Note the
location of the extra BAM info from $C0-D3.

@subsection Error codes

Here is the meaning of the error bytes added onto the end of
any extended D64. The CODE is the same as that generated by
the 1541 drive controller@dots{} it reports these numbers, not
the error code we usually see when an error occurs.

Some of what comes below is taken from Immers/Neufeld book
"Inside Commodore DOS". Note the descriptions are not
completely accurate as to what the drive DOS is actually
doing to seek/read/decode/write sectors, but serve as simple
examples only. The "type" field is where the error usually
occurs, whether it's searching for any SYNC mark, any header
ID, any valid header, or reading a sector.

Codes $0 and $C to $E are unused and never occur.

These first errors are "seek" errors, where the disk
controller is simply reading headers and looking at
descriptor bytes, checksums, format ID's and reporting what
errors it sees. These errors do *not* necessarily apply to
the exact sector being looked for. This fact makes
duplication of these errors very unreliable.

Code    : $03
Error   : 21
Type    : Seek
Message : No SYNC sequence found.

Each sector data block and header block are preceeded by
SYNC marks. If *no* sync sequence is found within 20
milliseconds (only ~1/10 of a disk rotation!) then this
error is generated. This error used to mean the entire
track is bad, but it does not have to be the case. Only
a small area of the track needs to be without a SYNC
mark and this error will be generated.

Converting this error to a D64 is very problematic
because it depends on where the physical head is on the
disk when a read attempt is made. If it is on valid
header/sectors then it won't occur. If it happens over
an area without SYNC marks, it will happen.

Code    : $02
Error   : 20
Type    : Seek
Message : Header descriptor byte not found (HEX $08, GCR $52)

Each sector is preceeded by an 8-byte GCR header block, which
starts with the value $52 (GCR). If this value is not found
after 90 attempts, this error is generated.

Basically, what a track has is SYNC marks, and possibly valid
data blocks, but no valid header descriptors.

Code    : $09
Error   : 27
Type    : Seek
Message : Checksum error in header block

The header block contains a checksum value, calculated by
XOR'ing the TRACK, SECTOR, ID1 and ID2 values. If this
checksum is wrong, this error is generated.

Code    : $0B
Error   : 29
Type    : Seek
Message : Disk sector ID mismatch

The ID's from the header block of the currently read sector are
compared against the ones from the low-level header of 18/0. If
there is a mismatch, this error is generated.

Code    : $02
Error   : 20
Type    : Seek
Message : Header block not found

This error can be reported again when searching for the correct
header block. An image of the header is built and searched for,
but not found after 90 read attempts. Note the difference from
the first occurance. The first one only searches for a valid
ID, not the whole header.

Note that error 20 occurs twice during this phase. The first
time is when a header ID is being searched for, the second is
when the proper header pattern for the sector being searched
for is not found.

From this point on, all the errors apply to the specific
sector you are looking for. If a read passed all the previous
checks, then we are at the sector being searched for.

Note that the entire sector is read before these errors are
detected. Therefore the data, checksum and off bytes are
available.

Code    : $04
Error   : 22
Type    : Read
Message : Data descriptor byte not found (HEX $07, GCR $55)

Each sector data block is preceeded by the value $07, the
"data block" descriptor. If this value is not there, this
error is generated. Each encoded sector has actually 260
bytes. First is the descriptor byte, then follows the
256 bytes of data, a checksum, and two "off" bytes.

Code    : $05
Error   : 23
Type    : Read
Message : Checksum error in data block

The checksum of the data read of the disk is calculated, and
compared against the one stored at the end of the sector. If
there's a discrepancy, this error is generated.

Code    : $0F
Error   : 74
Type    : Read
Message : Drive Not Ready (no disk in drive or no device 1)

These errors only apply when writing to a disk. I don't see the
usefulness of having these as they cannot be present when only
*reading* a disk.

Code    : $06
Error   : 24
Type    : Write
Message : Write verify (on format)

Code    : $07
Error   : 25
Type    : Write
Message : Write verify error

Once the GCR-encoded sector is written out, the drive waits for
the sector to come around again and verifies the whole 325-byte
GCR block. Any errors encountered will generate this error.

Code    : $08
Error   : 26
Type    : Write
Message : Write protect on

Self explanatory. Remove the write-protect tab, and try again.

Code    : $0A
Error   : 28
Type    : Write
Message : Write error

In actual fact, this error never occurs, but it is included
for completeness.

This is not an error at all, but it gets reported when the
read of a sector is ok.

Code    : $01
Error   : 00
Type    : N/A
Message : No error.

Self explanatory. No errors were detected in the reading
and decoding of the sector.

The advantage with using the 35 track D64 format, regardless of
error bytes, is that it can be converted directly back to a 1541
disk by either using the proper cable and software on the PC, or
send it down to the C64 and writing it back to a 1541. It is the
best documented format since it is also native to the C64, with
many books explaining the disk layout and the internals of the
1541.

*all* known C64 disk types (hard disk, floppies, etc). An X64
is created by prepending a 64-byte header to an existing image
(1541, 1571, etc) and setting specific bytes which describe
what type of image follows. This header has undergone some
revision, and this description is based on the 1.02 version,
which was the last known at the time of writing.

The most common X64 file you will see is the D64 variety,
typically 174912 bytes long (174848 for the D64 and 64 bytes
for the header, assuming no error bytes are appended). The
header layout (as used in 64COPY) is as follows:

@example

The first four bytes used for the device type at position $06
($00 to $03) are functionally the same, and are compatible with
older version of X64 files. Some old X64 files might have $00
for the device type (instead of $01), but it makes no real
difference.

As most instances of X64 files will be strictly 1541 images,
bytes $08-$3F are set to zero, and some versions of the X64
emulator don't use bytes $08-$3F.

@section The D71 disk image format

@c FIXME: the D71 section needs to be style-checked.

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

Similar to the D64 (1541), the 1571 drive can operate in either
single-sided (1541 compatible) mode or double-sided (1571) mode. In
this section I will be dealing with the double-sided mode only. For
the breakdown of the single-sided mode, see the D64 section.

The D71 has 70 tracks, double that of the 1541, with a DOS file
size of 349696 bytes. If the error byte block (1366 bytes) is
attached, this makes the file size 351062 bytes. The track range
and offsets into the D71 files are as follows:

The directory structure is the same as a D64/1541. All the same
filetypes apply, the directory still only holds 144 files per
disk and should only exist on track 18.

The first two bytes of the sector ($12/$04 or 18/4) indicate
the location of the next track/sector of the directory. If the
track value is set to $00, then it is the last sector of the
directory. It is possible, however unlikely, that the directory
may *not* be competely on track 18 (some disks do exist like
this). Just follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00. The
sector link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole
sector is allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter. The
drive will return all the available entries anyways. This is a
breakdown of a standard directory sector and entry:

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange
results. The 1571 is inconsistent in how it treats these bits.
Some routines use all 4 bits, others ignore bit 3, resulting in
values from 0-7.

When the 1571 is in is native ("1571") mode, files are stored
with a sector interleave of 6, rather than 10 which the 1541
(and the 1571 in "1541" mode) uses. The directory still uses an
interleave of 3.

@c @node FIXME
@subsection Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commodore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated
directory track where all filenames are stored. This limits the
number of files stored on a disk based on the number of sectors
on the directory track. There are some disk images that contain
more files than would normally be allowed. This requires
extending the directory off the default directory track by
changing the last directory sector pointer to a new track,
allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there. The directory of an
extended disk can be read and the files that reside there can be
loaded without problems on a real drive. However, this is still
a very dangerous practice as writing to the extended portion of
the directory will cause directory corruption in the non-
extended part. Many of the floppy drives core ROM routines
ignore the track value that the directory is on and assume the
default directory track for operations.

To explain: assume that the directory has been extended from
track 18 to track 19/6 and that the directory is full except
for a few slots on 19/6. When saving a new file, the drive DOS
will find an empty file slot at 19/6 offset $40 and correctly
write the filename and a few other things into this slot. When
the file is done being saved the final file information will
be written to 18/6 offset $40 instead of 19/6 causing some
directory corruption to the entry at 18/6. Also, the BAM
entries for the sectors occupied by the new file will not be
saved and the new file will be left as a SPLAT (*) file.

Attempts to validate the disk will result in those files
residing off the directory track to not be allocated in the
BAM, and could also send the drive into an endless loop. The
default directory track is assumed for all sector reads when
validating so if the directory goes to 19/6, then the validate
code will read 18/6 instead. If 18/6 is part of the normal
directory chain then the validate routine will loop endlessly.

@c @node FIXME
@subsection Bam layout
The BAM is somewhat different as it now has to
take 35 new tracks into account. In order to do this, most of
the extra BAM information is stored on track 53/0, and the
remaining sectors on track 53 are marked in the BAM as
allocated. This does mean that except for one allocated
sector on track 53, the rest of the track is unused and
wasted. (Track 53 is the equivalent to track 18, but on the
flip side of the disk). Here is a dump of the first BAM
sector@dots{}

The "free sector" entries for tracks 36-70 are likely included
here in the first BAM sector due to some memory restrictions in
the 1571 drive. There is only enough memory available for one
BAM sector, but in order to generate the "blocks free" value at
the end of a directory listing, the drive needs to know the
extra track "free sector" values. It does make working with the
BAM a little more difficult, though.

These are the values that would normally be with the 4-byte BAM
entry, but the rest of the entry is contained on 53/0.

Note: If the DOS version byte is set to anything other than $41
or $00, then we have what is called "soft write protection". Any
attempt to write to the disk will return the "DOS Version" error
code 73. The 1571 is simply telling you that it thinks the disk
format version is incorrect.

The BAM entries require some explanation. Take the first entry
at bytes $04-$07 ($12 $FF $F9 $17). The first byte ($12) is the
number of free sectors on that track. Since we are looking at the
track 1 entry, this means it has 18 (decimal) free sectors.

The next three bytes represent the bitmap of which sectors are
used/free. Since it is 3 bytes (8 bits/byte) we have 24 bits of
storage. Remember that at most, each track only has 21 sectors,
so there are a few unused bits. These entries must be viewed in
binary to make any sense. We will use the first entry (track 1)
at bytes 04-07:

@example
 FF=11111111, F9=11111001, 17=00010111
@end example

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the
bits around.

@example
            111111 11112222
 01234567 89012345 67890123
 --------------------------
 11111111 10011111 11101000
 ^                     ^
 sector 0           sector 20
@end example

Since we are on the first track, we have 21 sectors, and only
use up to the bit 20 position. If a bit is on (1), the sector
is free. Therefore, track 1 has sectors 9,10 and 19 used, all
the rest are free.

In order to complete the BAM, we must check 53/0.

@example
    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

@end example

Each track from 36-70 has 3 byte entries, starting at
address $00.

@example
Byte: $00-$02: $FF $FF $1F - BAM map for track 36
      $03-$05: $FF $FF $1F - BAM map for track 37
      @dots{}
      $33-$35: $00 $00 $00 - BAM map for track 53
      @dots{}
      $66-$68: $FF $FF $01 - BAM map for track 70
      $69-$FF:             - Not used
@end example

You can break down the entries for tracks 36-70 the same way as
track 1, just combine the free sector bytes from 18/0 and the BAM
usage from 53 to get the full 4-byte entry.

Just like a D64, you can attach error bytes to the file, for
sector error information. This block is 1366 bytes long, 1 byte
for each of the 1366 sectors in the image. With the error bytes,
the file size is 351062 bytes.

@node D81, D80, D71, File formats
@section The D81 disk image format

@c FIXME: the D81 section needs to be style-checked.

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

Like D64 and D71, this is a byte for byte copy of a physical 1581
disk. It consists of 80 tracks, 40 sectors each (0 to 39) for a
size of 819200 bytes, or 3200 sectors. If the error byte block is
attached, this makes the file size 822400 bytes.

There are three sectors on the directory track used for disk
internals (header and BAM), leaving 37 sectors for filename
entries, thus allowing for 296 files (37 * 8) to be stored at the
root level of the disk.

The actual physical layout on the disk is quite different from what
the user sees, but this is unimportant to the scope of this section.
One important difference from the D64 and D71 is all the sector
interleaves are now 1 for both files and directory storage (rather
than 3 for directory and 10 for file on a D64/D71). This is due to
the built-in buffering in the 1581. When reading a sector, the
whole track will be buffered in memory, and any sectors being
modified will be done in memory. Once it has to be written, the
whole track will be written out in one step.

The track range and offsets into the D81 files are as follows:

The header sector is stored at 40/0, and contains the disk name,
ID and DOS version bytes, but the BAM is no longer contained here
(like the D64).

Note: If the DOS version byte is changed to anything other than
a $44 (or $00), then we have what is called "soft write
protection". Any attempt to write to the disk will return the
"DOS Version" error code 73. The drive is simply telling you
that it thinks the disk format version is incompatible.

The directory track should be contained totally on track 40.
Sectors 3-39 contain the entries and sector 1 and 2 contain the
BAM (Block Availability Map). Sector 0 holds the disk name and
ID. The first directory sector is always 40/3, even though the
t/s pointer at 40/0 (first two bytes) might point somewhere
else. It goes linearly up the sector count, 3-4-5-6-etc. Each
sector holds up to eight entries.

The first two bytes of the sector ($28/$04) indicate the location
of the next track/sector of the directory (40/4). If the track is
set to $00, then it is the last sector of the directory. It is
possible, however unlikely, that the directory may *not* be
competely on track 40. Just follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done (track=$00), the sector should contain
an $FF, meaning the whole sector is allocated. Theactual value
doesn't matter as all the entries will be returned anyways. Each
directory sector has the following layout:

@subsection Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory
track where all filenames are stored. This limits the number of
files stored on a disk based on the number of sectors on the
directory track. There are some disk images that contain more
files than would normally be allowed. This requires extending the
directory off the default directory track by changing the last
directory sector pointer to a new track, allocating the new
sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or moving existing)
file entries there. The directory of an extended disk can be read
and the files that reside there can be loaded without problems on
a real drive. However, this is still a very dangerous practice as
writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part. Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the
directory is on and assume the default directory track for
operations.

@c @node FIXME
@subsection BAM layout

The BAM is located on 40/1 (for side 0, tracks 1-40) and 40/2
(for side 1, tracks 41-80). Each entry takes up six bytes, one
for the "free sector" count and five for the allocation bitmap.

@example
    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

$16-$1B: BAM entry for track 2 (track 42, side 1)
         @dots{}

         @dots{}
$BE-$C3: BAM entry for track 30 (track 70, side 1)
         @dots{}
$FA-$FF: BAM entry for track 40 (track 80, side 1)
@end example

The BAM entries require some explanation, so lets look at the
track 40 entry at bytes $FA-FF ($24 $F0 $FF $2D $FF $FE). The
first byte ($24, or 36 decimal) is the number of free sectors
on that track. The next five bytes represent the bitmap of
which sectors are used/free. Since it is five bytes
(8 bits/byte) we have 40 bits of storage. Since this format
has 40 sectors/track, the whole five bytes are used.

@example
 F0: .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 24 F0 FF 2D FF FE
@end example

The last five bytes of any BAM entry must be viewed in binary
to make any sense. We will once again use track 40 as our
reference:

@example
 F0=11110000, FF=11111111, 2D=00101101, FF=11111111, FE=11111110
@end example

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the
bits around.

@example
                   111111 11112222 22222233 33333333
 Sector 01234567 89012345 67890123 45678901 23456789
        -------------------------- -------- --------
        00001111 11111111 10110100 11111111 01111111
@end example

Note that if a bit is on (1), the sector is free. Therefore,
track 40 has sectors 0-3, 17, 20, 22, 23 and 32 used, all the
rest are free.

The second BAM (for side 1) contains the entries for tracks
41-80.

@example
    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

It is laid out exactly as the side 0 BAM except for one
difference. The track/sector reference for the next sector
should be set to $00/$FF, indicating there is no next sector.

@c @node FIXME
@subsection REL files 
The REL filetype requires some extra explaining.
It was designed to make access to data *anywhere* on the disk
very fast. Take a look at this directory entry@dots{}

@example
 00: 00 FF 84 27 00 41 44 44 49 54 49 4F 4E 41 4C 20
 10: 49 4E 46 4F A0 27 02 FE 00 00 00 00 00 00 D2 0B
@end example

The third byte ($84) indicates this entry is a REL file and
that the three normally empty entries at offset $15, $16 and
$17 are now used as they are explained above. It's the
track/sector chain that this entry points to, called the SUPER
SIDE SECTOR, which is of interest here (in this case, 39/2).
The SUPER SIDE SECTOR is very different from the D64 format. If
you check the D64 entry for a REL file and do the calculations,
you will find that the maximum file size of the REL file is 720
data sectors. With the new SUPER SIDE SECTOR, you can now have
126 groups of these SIDE SECTORS chains, allowing for file
sizes up to (theoretically) 90720 sectors, or about 22.15
Megabytes.

Here is a dump of the beginning of the SUPER SIDE SECTOR@dots{}

@example
 00: 27 01 FE 27 01 15 09 03 0F 38 16 4A 1C 00 00 00

 20: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

@example
Bytes:
$00-$01: Track/sector of first side sector in group 0
    $02: Always $FE
$03-$04: Track/sector of first side sector in group 0 (again)
         @dots{}
$FD-$FE: Track/sector of first side sector in group 125
    $FF: Unused (likely $00)
@end example

The side sector layout is the same as the D64/1571.

@subsection 1581 Partitions and Sub-directories

At the beginning of this section it was stated that the 1581 can
hold 296 entries "at the root level". The 1581 also has the
ability to partition areas of the disk. Under the right
conditions these can become sub-directories, acting as a small
diskette, complete with its own directory and BAM. When you are
inside of a sub-directory, no other files except those in that
directory are visible, or can be affected.

To the 1581, this file will show up as a "CBM" filetype in a
directory. All this does is tell the disk that a file, starting
at X/Y track/sector and Z sectors large exists. Doing a validate
will not harm these files as they have a directory entry, and
are fully allocated in the BAM.

There are two main uses for partitions. One is to simply
allocate a section of the disk to be used for direct-access
reads/writes, and lock it away from being overwritten after a
VALIDATE. The second is as a sub-directory, basically a small
"disk within a disk".

In order to use a partition as a sub-directory, it must adhere
to the following four rules:

@example
 1. If must start on sector 0
 2. It's size must be in multiples of 40 sectors
 3. It must be a minimum of 120 sectors long (3 tracks)
 4. If must not start on or cross track 40, which limits the
    biggest directory to 1600 sectors (tracks 1-39).
@end example

This is a dump of a sub-directory entry:

@example
 00: 00 FF 85 29 00 50 41 52 54 49 54 49 4F 4E 20 31
 10: A0 A0 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 06
@end example

It is a partition starting on track 41/0, extends for 1600
sectors, and has been formatted as a sub-directory. Note that
when a partition is created, the area being allocated is not
touched in any way. If you want it set up as a sub-directory,
you must issue the FORMAT command to the 1581 to create the
central directory and BAM. Also note that from the directory
entry you can't tell whether it is a sub-directory or not, just
that it fits the sub-directory parameters.

The BAM track for the sub-directory exists on the first track of
the partition, and has the same layout as the disk BAM on track
40. The biggest difference is the "disk name" is what what given
when the partition was formatted rather than what the actual
disk name is. Also, except for the free sectors in the partition
area, all other sectors in the BAM will be allocated.

If the partition size doesn't match the above rules for a
sub-directory, it will simply exist as a "protected" area of the
disk, and can't be used as a sub-directory. Either way, it still
shows up as a "CBM" type in a directory listing. Below is a dump
of a 10-sector partition starting on track 5/1, which does not
qualify as a sub-directory@dots{}

@example
 00: 00 00 85 05 01 53 4D 41 4C 4C 50 41 52 54 20 32
 10: A0 A0 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0A 00
@end example

The master BAM shows the entry for this partition on track 5@dots{}

@example
 00: 28 02 44 BB 43 44 C0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
 10: 23 C1 FF FF FF FF 28 FF FF FF FF FF 28 FF FF FF
 20: FF FF 28 FF FF FF FF FF 1E 01 F8 FF FF FF 28 FF
                             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
@end example

The breakdown of the BAM shows the allocation for this track,
with sectors 1-10 allocated, as it should be.

@example
 10000000 00011111 11111111 11111111 11111111
 ^          ^          ^         ^          ^
 0          10         20        30         39
@end example

Partitions and sub-directories share one very important trait.
When created, the sub-directory entry simply has the starting
track/sector and the size of the partition in sectors.
Partitions are created linearly, meaning if one starts on 30/1
and is of size 15 sectors, then the sector range from 1 through
15 on track 30 will be allocated. If a partition size crosses
a track boundary, the allocation will continue on the next
track starting on sector 0, and going up.

The section allocated will *not* have a track/sector chain like
a file would, but rather is dependant on the directory entry to
keep it from being overwritten. You can store whatever you want
to in the allocated area.

@c @node FIXME
@subsection AUTO-BOOT LOADER

If byte $07 in the BAM is set, then when the drive is reset
(and other circumstances) it will look for a USR file called
"COPYRIGHT CBM 86". This file will then be loaded into the
drive RAM and executed.

The format for this auto-loader file is fairly basic. It
starts with a two-byte load address, a size byte, program data,
and a checksum at the end.

@example
Bytes:
       $00-$01: Load address, low/high format
           $02: Size of program (SZ) (smaller than 256 bytes)
$03-($03+SZ-1): Program data
        $03+SZ: Checksum byte
@end example

@node D80, D82, D81, File formats
@section The D80 disk image format

@c FIXME: the D80 section needs to be style-checked.

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

This is a sector-for-sector copy of an 8050 floppy disk. The
file size for an 8050 image is 533248 bytes. It is comprised
of 256-byte sectors arranged across 77 tracks, with a
varying number of sectors per track for a total of 2083
sectors. Track counting starts at 1 (not 0) and sector
counting starts at 0 (not 1), therefore a track with 29
sectors will go from 0 to 28.

The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in
circles, with track 1 on the very outside of the disk
(closest to the sides) to track 77 being on the inside of
the disk (closest to the inner hub ring). Commodore, in
their infinite wisdom, varied the number of sectors per
track and data densities across the disk to optimize
available storage, resulting in the chart below. It shows
the sectors/track for a D80. Since the outside diameter of a
circle is the largest (versus closer to the center), the
outside tracks have the largest amount of storage.

The BAM (Block Availability Map) is on track 38. The D80 is only
77 tracks and so the BAM is contained on 38/0 and 38/3. The BAM
interleave is 3.

The directory is on track 39, with 39/0 contains the header
(DOS type, disk name, disk ID's) and sectors 1-28 contain the
directory entries. Both files and the directory use an
interleave of 1. Since the directory is only 28 sectors large
(29 less one for the header), and each sector can contain only
8 entries (32 bytes per entry), the maximum number of directory
entries is 28 * 8 = 224. The first directory sector is always
39/1. It then follows a chain structure using a sector
interleave of 1 making the links go 39/1, 39/2, 39/3 etc.

When reading a disk, you start with 39/0 (disk label/ID) which
points to 38/0 (BAM0), 38/3 (BAM1), and finally to 39/1 (first
dir entry sector). When writing a file to a blank disk, it will
start at 38/1 because 38/0 is already allocated.

Below is a dump of the header sector 39/0:

The first two bytes of the directory sector ($27/$02) indicate
the location of the next track/sector of the directory (39/2).
If the track is set to $00, then it is the last sector of the
directory.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00. The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter. The drive will
return all the available entries anyways. This is a breakdown of a
standard directory sector:

@c @node FIXME
@subsection Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated
directory track where all filenames are stored. This limits the
number of files stored on a disk based on the number of sectors
on the directory track. There are some disk images that contain
more files than would normally be allowed. This requires
extending the directory off the default directory track by
changing the last directory sector pointer to a new track,
allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there. The directory of an
extended disk can be read and the files that reside there can
be loaded without problems on a real drive. However, this is
still a very dangerous practice as writing to the extended
portion of the directory will cause directory corruption in the
non-extended part. Many of the floppy drives core ROM routines
ignore the track value that the directory is on and assume the
default directory track for operations.

@c @node FIXME
@subsection BAM layout

The BAM only occupies up to four sectors on track 38, so the
rest of the track is empty and is available for file storage.
Below is a dump of the first BAM block, 38/0. A D80 will only
contain two BAM sectors, 38/0 and 38/3. Each entry takes 5
bytes, 1 for the free count on that track, and 4 for the BAM
bits.

@example
    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

Being bit-based, the BAM entries need some explanation. The
first track entry in the above BAM sector is at offset 06,
"1D FF FF FF 1F". The first number is how many blocks are
free on this track ($1D=29) and the remainder is the bit
representation of the usage map for the track. These
entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense. First
convert the values to binary:

@example
 FF=11111111, FF=11111111, FF=11111111, 1F=00011111
@end example

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the
bits around.

@example
            111111 11112222 222222
 01234567 89012345 67890123 456789@dots{}
 -------------------------- ---------
 11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000
 ^                              ^
 sector 0                   sector 28
@end example

Since we are on the first track, we have 29 sectors, and only
use up to the bit 28 position. If a bit is on (1), the sector
is free. Therefore, track 1 is clean, all sectors are free.
Any leftover bits that refer to sectors that don't exist,
like bits 29-31 in the above example, are set to allocated.

Second BAM block 38/3.

@section The D82 disk image format

@c FIXME: the D82 section needs to be style-checked.

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

This is a sector-for-sector copy of an 8250 floppy disk. The file
size for an 8250 image is 1066496 bytes. It is comprised of
256-byte sectors arranged across 154 tracks, with a varying
number of sectors per track for a total of 4166 sectors. Track
counting starts at 1 (not 0) and sector counting starts at 0
(not 1), therefore a track with 29 sectors will go from 0 to 28.

The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in
circles, with track 1 on the very outside of the disk (closest
to the sides) to track 77 being on the inside of the disk
(closest to the inner hub ring). Commodore, in their infinite
wisdom, varied the number of sectors per track and data
densities across the disk to optimize available storage,
resulting in the chart below. It shows the sectors/track for a
D82. Since the outside diameter of a circle is the largest
(versus closer to the center), the outside tracks have the
largest amount of storage.

The BAM (Block Availability Map) is on track 38. The D82 is 154
tracks and so the BAM is contained on 38/0, 38/3, 38/6 and 38/9.
The BAM interleave is 3.

The directory is on track 39, with 39/0 contains the header (DOS
type, disk name, disk ID's) and sectors 1-28 contain the
directory entries. Both files and the directory use an
interleave of 1. Since the directory is only 28 sectors large
(29 less one for the header), and each sector can contain only 8
entries (32 bytes per entry), the maximum number of directory
entries is 28 * 8 = 224. The first directory sector is always
39/1. It then follows a chain structure using a sector
interleave of 1 making the links go 39/1, 39/2, 39/3 etc.

When reading a disk, you start with 39/0 (disk label/ID) which
points to 38/0 (BAM0), 38/3 (BAM1), 38/6 (BAM2), 38/9 (BAM3, and
finally to 39/1 (first dir entry sector). When writing a file to
a blank disk, it will start at 38/1 because 38/0 is already
allocated.

Below is a dump of the header sector 39/0:

The first two bytes of the directory sector ($27/$02) indicate
the location of the next track/sector of the directory (39/2).
If the track is set to $00, then it is the last sector of the
directory.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00. The
sector link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole
sector is allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter. The
drive will return all the available entries anyways. This is a
breakdown of a standard directory sector:

@subsection Non-Standard & Long Directories

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated
directory track where all filenames are stored. This limits the
number of files stored on a disk based on the number of sectors
on the directory track. There are some disk images that contain
more files than would normally be allowed. This requires
extending the directory off the default directory track by
changing the last directory sector pointer to a new track,
allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there. The directory of an
extended disk can be read and the files that reside there can
be loaded without problems on a real drive. However, this is
still a very dangerous practice as writing to the extended
portion of the directory will cause directory corruption in the
non-extended part. Many of the floppy drives core ROM routines
ignore the track value that the directory is on and assume the
default directory track for operations.

@c @node FIXME
@subsection BAM layout

The BAM only occupies up to four sectors on track 38, so the
rest of the track is empty and is available for file storage.
Below is a dump of the first BAM block, 38/0. A D82 will
contain four BAM sectors, 38/0, 38/3, 38/6 and 38/9. Each
entry takes 5 bytes, 1 for the free count on that track, and
4 for the BAM bits.

@example
    00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F

Being bit-based, the BAM entries need some explanation. The
first track entry in the above BAM sector is at offset 06,
"1D FF FF FF 1F". The first number is how many blocks are free
on this track ($1D=29) and the remainder is the bit
representation of the usage map for the track. These entries
must be viewed in binary to make any sense. First convert the
values to binary:

@example
 FF=11111111, FF=11111111, FF=11111111, 1F=00011111
@end example

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the
bits around.

@end example

Since we are on the first track, we have 29 sectors, and only
use up to the bit 28 position. If a bit is on (1), the sector is
free. Therefore, track 1 is clean, all sectors are free. Any
leftover bits that refer to sectors that don't exist, like bits
29-31 in the above example, are set to allocated.

@section The P00 image format

@c FIXME: the P00 section needs to be style-checked.

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

These files were created for use in the PC64 emulator, written
by Wolfgang Lorenz. Each one has the same layout with the
filetype being stored in the DOS extension (i.e. Pxx is a PRG,
Sxx is a SEQ, Uxx is a USR and Rxx is a RELative file), and the
header is only 26 bytes long.

This is a dump of a Pxx file (PRG)@dots{}

The 'xx' in the extension of the file is usually 00, except when
we have two DOS filenames which would be the same, but the C64
filenames are different! If we have two C64 filenames which are
the same, they *cannot* co-exist in the same directory. If we
have two files which do convert down to be the same DOS
filename, the extension is incremented until an unused one is
found (x01, x02, x03, up to x99). We can have up to 99 different
C64 files with the same corresponding DOS names as that's all
the extension will hold (from P00 to P99).

Each PC64 file only has one entry, there are no multi-file
containers allowed. This could result in a large number of
these files in a directory, even for only a few programs, as
each C64 file will result in a PC64 file entry. The best use
for a PC64 file is a single-file program, one which does not
load anything else.

@section The CRT cartridge image format

This chapter is based on CRT.txt (rev1.14) compiled by Peter Schepers, with
additional contributions from Per Hakan Sundell, Markus Brenner,
Marco Van Den Heuvel, Groepaz.

  Cartridge files were introduced in the CCS64  emulator,  written  by  Per
Hakan Sundell, and use the ".CRT" file extension. This format  was  created
to handle the various ROM cartridges that exist, such as Action Replay, the
Power cartridge, and the Final Cartridge.

  Normal game cartridges can load  into  several  different  memory  ranges
($8000-9FFF,  $A000-BFFF  or  $E000-FFFF).  Newer   utility   and   freezer
cartridges were less intrusive, hiding themselves until  called  upon,  and
still others used bank-switching techniques to allow much larger ROM's than
normal. Because of these "stealthing" and bank-switching methods, a special
cartridge format  was  necessary,  to  let  the  emulator  know  where  the
cartridge should reside, the control line  states  to  enable  it  and  any
special hardware features it uses.

  From the above chart, the following table can be built. It shows standard
cartridges, either 8K or 16K in size, and the memory ranges they load into.

@example
Type     Size   Game   EXRom  Low Bank  High Bank
         in K   Line   Line    (ROML)    (ROMH)
-------------------------------------------------
Normal    8k     hi     lo     $8000      ----
Normal    16k    lo     lo     $8000     $A000
Ultimax   8k     lo     hi     $E000      ----
@end example

  The ROMH and ROML lines are CPU-controlled status  lines,  used  to  bank
in/out RAM, ROM or I/O, depending on what is needed at the time.

  Ultimax cartridges typically are situated  in  the  $E000-FFFF  (8K)  ROM
address range. There are some cartridges  which  only  use  4K  of  the  8K
allocation. If the cartridge is 16K in size, then it will  reside  in  both
$8000-9FFF and $E000-FFFF.

    This cart has 32Kb of ROM, and 8Kb of RAM. The bank switching  is  done
    by writing to the I/O-1 range as follows:

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    7    extra ROM bank selector (A15) (unused)
    6    1 = resets FREEZE-mode (turns back to normal mode)
    5    1 = enable RAM at ROML ($8000-$9FFF) &
             I/O-2 ($DF00-$DFFF = $9F00-$9FFF)
    4    ROM bank selector high (A14)
    3    ROM bank selector low  (A13)
    2    1 = disable cartridge (turn off $DE00)
    1    1 = /EXROM high

    Additionally the RAM or ROM can be available through a  window  in  the
    I/O-2 range.

@end example

    A total of 64 kB of ROM memory  is  organized  into  four  $4000  banks
    located at $8000-$BFFF.

    The banks are arranged in the following way:

@example
    Bank 0:  BASIC, Monitor, Disk-Turbo
    Bank 1:  Notepad, BASIC (Menu Bar)
    Bank 2:  Desktop, Freezer/Print
    Bank 3:  Freezer, Compression
@end example

    The cartridges uses the entire I/O-1 and I/O-2 range. Bank switching is
    done by writing the bank number plus $40 into  memory  location  $DFFF.
    For instance, to select bank 2, $DFFF is set to $42.

    The CRT file contains four CHIP blocks, each block with a start address
    of $8000, length $4000 and the bank number in the bank  field.  In  the
    cartridge header, both EXROM ($18) and GAME  ($19)  are  set  to  1  to
    enable the 16 kB ROM configuration.

    The registers are arranged in the following way:

    One register at $DFFF:

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    7      Hide this register (1 = hidden)
    6      NMI line  (0 = low = active) *1)
    5      GAME line  (0 = low = active) *2)
    4      EXROM line (0 = low = active)
    2-3    unassigned (usually set to 0)
    0-1    number of bank to show at $8000
@end example

    1) if either the freezer button is pressed, or bit 6 is 0, then an  NMI
       is generated

    2) if the freezer button is pressed, GAME is also forced low

    The rest of I/O-1/I/O-2 contain a mirror of the last  2  pages  of  the
    currently selected ROM bank (also at $dfff, contrary to what some other
    documents say)

@end example

    Simons' BASIC permanently uses 16 kB ($4000) bytes of cartridge  memory
    from $8000-$BFFF. However, through some custom bank-switching logic the
    upper area ($A000-$BFFF) may be disabled so Simons' BASIC may use it as
    additional RAM. Writing a value of $01 to address location $DE00  banks
    in ROM, $00 disables ROM and enables RAM.

    The CRT file contains two CHIP blocks of length $2000 each,  the  first
    block having a start address of $8000, the second block $A000.  In  the
    cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set  to  1  to
    indicate the RESET/power-up configuration of 8 kB ROM.

    The 512Kb type of cart has 64  banks  of  8Kb  ($2000),  banked  in  at
    $8000-$9FFF.

    Bank switching is done by writing to $DE00. The lower six bits give the
    bank number (ranging from 0-63). Bit 7 in this selection word is always

@end example

    The FUN PLAY Cartridge uses $DE00 for  bank  selection,  and  uses  8Kb
    banks ($2000) at $8000-$9FFF. There are 16 banks of ROM memory and  are
    referenced by the following values:

@example
    $00 -> Bank 0
    $08 -> Bank 1
    $10 -> Bank 2
    $18 -> Bank 3
    $20 -> Bank 4
    $28 -> Bank 5
    $30 -> Bank 6
    $38 -> Bank 7
    $01 -> Bank 8
    $09 -> Bank 9
    $11 -> Bank 10
    $19 -> Bank 11
    $21 -> Bank 12
    $29 -> Bank 13
    $31 -> Bank 14
    $39 -> Bank 15
@end example

    The bank field in the chip  headers  is  set  according  to  the  value
    written to $DE00. The following bits are  used  for  bank  decoding  in
    $DE00 (0 being the LSB, 3 being the MSB).

@example
        Bit# 76543210
             xx210xx3
@end example

    After copying memory from the ROM banks, the selection  program  writes
    a value of $86 to $DE00. This seems either  to  reset  or  disable  the
    cartridge ROM.

@end example

    The Super Games cartridge  uses  4  16Kb  banks  ($8000-$BFFF)  of  ROM
    memory. Bank selecting is done by writing to $DF00.

    $DF00 register is as follows:

@example
    bit   meaning
    ---   -------
     0    bank bit 0
     1    bank bit 1
     2    mode (0 = EXROM/GAME (bridged on the same wire - 16k config) 
                1 = cartridge disabled)
     3    write-protect-latch  (1 = no more changes are possible until 
                                    the next hardware-reset )
    4-7   unused

@end example

    This cart has 32Kb of ROM and 8Kb of RAM

    Writing to I/O-1 will do the following:

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    7    extra ROM bank selector (A15) (unused)
    6    1 = resets FREEZE-mode (turns back to normal mode)
    5    1 = enable RAM at ROML ($8000-$9FFF) &
             I/O-2 ($DF00-$DFFF = $9F00-$9FFF)
    4    ROM bank selector high (A14)
    3    ROM bank selector low  (A13)
    2    1 = disable cartridge (turn off $DE00)
    1    1 = /EXROM high
    0    1 = /GAME low
@end example

    If bit 5 (RAM enable) is 1, bit 0,1 (exrom/game) is ==  2  (cart  off),
    bit 2,6,7 (cart disable, freeze clear) are 0, then cart ROM (Bank 0..3)
    is mapped at 8000-9FFF, and cart RAM (Bank 0) is  mapped  at  A000-BFFF
    and cart RAM (Bank 0) is is enabled in the I/O-2 area using  16Kb  game
    config.

    The cart RAM or ROM is available through a window in the I/O-2 range.

@end example

    The Epyx FastLoad cart uses a simple capacitor to toggle the ROM on
    and off:

    the capacitor is discharged, and 8k game config enabled, by either
    reading ROML or reading I/O-1. If none of those accesses happen the
    capacitor will charge, and if it is charged (after 512 cycles) then
    the ROM will get disabled.

@end example

    ROM memory is organized in 8Kb ($2000) banks  located  at  $8000-$9FFF.
    Bank switching is done by writing to address $DE00+X, where  X  is  the
    bank number (STA $DE00,X). For instance, to read from bank  3,  address
    $DE03 is written to. Reading from anywhere  in  the  I/O-1  range  will
    disable the cart.

    The CRT file contains a string of CHIP blocks, each block with a  start
    address of $8000, length $2000 and the bank number in the  bank  field.
    In the cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set  to
    1 to enable the 8 kB ROM configuration.

    After  RESET  or  POWER  ON,  16kB  of  cartridge  ROM  is  visible  at
    $8000-$BFFF. Additionally,  ROM  normally  located  at  $9E00-$9FFF  is
    mirrored into I/O-1 and I/O-2 at $DE00-$DFFF.  ROM  at  $8000-$BFFF  is
    disabled by writing into the I/O-2 area (typically $DF00)  and  may  be
    re-enabled by writing into  I/O-1  ($DE00).  However,  the  $DE00-$DFFF
    (I/O-1/I/O-2) area itself always remains mapped to cartridge ROM.

    The (Super) Zaxxon carts use a 4Kb ($1000) ROM at $8000-$8FFF (mirrored
    in $9000-$9FFF) along with two 8Kb ($2000) cartridge banks  located  at
    $A000-$BFFF. One of the two banks is selected by doing a read access to
    either the $8000-$8FFF area (bank 0 is selected) or to $9000-$9FFF area
    (bank 1 is selected). EXROM ($18 = $00) and GAME ($19 = $00) lines  are
    always pulled to GND to select the 16 kB ROM configuration.

    The CRT file includes three CHIP blocks:
@example
    a) bank = 0, load address = $8000, size = $1000
    b) bank = 0, load address = $A000, size = $2000
    c) bank = 1, load address = $A000, size = $2000

    This cartridge type is very similar to the OCEAN cart type: ROM  memory
    is  organized  in  8Kb  ($2000)  banks  located  at  $8000-$9FFF.  Bank
    switching is done by writing the bank number to $DE00. Deviant from the
    Ocean type, bit 7 is cleared for selecting one of the ROM banks. If bit
    7 is set ($DE00 = $80), the GAME/EXROM lines are disabled,  turning  on
    RAM at $8000-$9FFF instead of ROM.

    In the cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set  to
    1 to indicate the RESET/power-up configuration of 8 kB ROM.

    Here is a list of the known cartridges:

@example
    Ghosbusters        (HES Australia)   (32 kB)
    Magic Desk         (Commodore)       (32 kB)

    The Comal-80 Cartridge uses 16Kb banks ($4000) at $8000-$BFFF. There are 4
    banks of ROM memory and the cart has 1 (write-only) bank control register which
    is located at $DE00 and mirrored throughout the $DE00-$DEFF range.

    This is an eprom cartridge. It has 1 2764 (8Kb) which  holds  the  base
    eprom with the base menu, and 2 27256 eproms of  which  8Kb  parts  are
    banked into the $8000-9FFF area.

    The bank selecting is done by writing to $DE00. The following bits  are
    used for bank decoding in $DE00 (0 being the LSB, 3 being the MSB).

@example
         Bit# 76543210
              xx10xx32
@end example

    Any bank value below 4 or above 11 switches in the base bank (bank 0).

    The bit values for each eprom bank are :

@example
    eprom bank 1 : xx00xx01
    eprom bank 2 : xx01xx01
    eprom bank 3 : xx10xx01
    eprom bank 4 : xx11xx01
    eprom bank 5 : xx00xx10
    eprom bank 6 : xx01xx10
    eprom bank 7 : xx10xx10
    eprom bank 8 : xx11xx10
@end example

    Setting bit 7 high will switch off EXROM.

    This is an eprom cartridge. It has 8 8Kb banks of which the first holds
    the base menu, the other eproms can be banked into the $8000-9FFF area.

    The bank selecting is done by writing to $DE00. Each low bit is used to
    bank in the respective eprom. If all bits are high then  the  EXROM  is
    switched off.

    The bit values for each eprom bank is:

@example
    eprom bank 1 : 11111110 ($FE) (base eprom)
    eprom bank 2 : 11111101 ($FD)

    This is an eprom cartridge. It has 9 eprom sockets, of which the  first
    holds the base eprom with the base menu which  is  an  8Kb  eprom,  the
    other eprom sockets can handle 8Kb, 16Kb or 32Kb eproms, of  which  8kb
    can be banked into the $8000-9FFF area.

    The bank selecting is done by  writing  to  $DFA0.  Bits  2,  1  and  0
    determine which socket is used and bits 5 and 4 are used to  select  an
    8Kb piece of the eprom.

    The possible values for bits 5 and 4 for the (extra) eprom banks are:

@example
     8Kb        : 3, 2, 1, 0

    16Kb bank 0 : 2, 0
    16Kb bank 1 : 3, 1

    32Kb bank 0 : 0
    32Kb bank 1 : 1
    32Kb bank 2 : 2

    This cart has 32Kb of ROM, bank 0 is in the cart image but is  unused.
    The first 8Kb of the cart image is unused, the second 8Kb of the  cart
    image is mapped to $E000-$FFFF, the third 8Kb of  the  cart  image  is
    mapped to $8000-$9FFF and the fourth 8Kb of the cart image  is  mapped
    to $A000-$BFFF. An NMI can be triggered by the cart, if address  $0001
    is written to and the cartridge is enabled. The cart can  be  disabled
    by software, by clearing bit 4 when writing to $DF00-$DFFF.  Cart  ROM
    at $E000-$FFFF can be disabled by setting bit 5 to 0 when  writing  to
    $DF00-$DFFF. Cart ROM at $8000-$BFFF can be disabled by setting bit  6
    to 1 when  writing  to  $DF00-$DFFF.  Bit  7  of  a  byte  written  to
    $DF00-$DFFF can be read back from the cartridge  if  enabled  (like  a

@end example

    This cart has 16Kb of ROM, of which the first  8Kb  is  mapped  in  at
    $8000-$9FFF and the second 8Kb is used as a  kernel  replacement.  The
    kernel replacement is achieved by a clip that needs  to  be  installed
    inside the C64.

    Reading from I/O-1 causes a capacitor to get charged with every  read,
    once the capacitor is charged enough it switches the cart on.

    Reading from I/O-2 causes a different capacitor to  get  charged  with
    every read, once the capacitor is charged enough it switched the  cart
    off.

    EasyFlash is a 1 MByte Flash EPROM card with  multiple  configurations
    and banks possible, it also has 256 bytes of RAM which is mapped  into
    the I/O-2 range.

    There are two control registers, one at $DE00 and one at $DE02.

    The register at $DE00 does the following:

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    7    LED control
    6-3  Unused
    2    Mode (0/1)
    1    Exrom line control
    0    Game line control
@end example

    The register at $DE02 controls which bank  is  mapped  into  ROMH  and
    ROML.

    This cart has 8Kb of ROM which is mapped to  $E000,  and  8Kb  of  RAM
    which is mapped to $6000. The cartridge is disabled after a reset.

    When the freeze button is pressed the following happens:

@itemize @bullet
@item an NMI is generated
@item as soon as the current adress is in bank 0xfe the cart  switches  to
      ultimax  mode.  The  cart  ROM  then  contains  one  page  full   of
      "jmp $eaea", which ultimately calls the freezer code.
@item the $FFF7/$FFF8 "register" logic is enabled and any access (read  or
      write) to $FFF7 will turn the cart_enabled off (leave ultimax mode),
      and an access to $FFF8 will turn the cart  back  on  (enter  ultimax
      mode). the "register logic" that causes this can  only  be  disabled
      again by a hardware reset.

    The Retro Replay has three registers: Two write-only ($DE00  &  $DE01)
    and one read-only register ($DE00 & $DE01 giving the same results).

    The register at $DE00 is reset to $00 on a hard reset if not in  flash
    mode. If in flash mode, it is set to  $02  in  order  to  prevent  the
    computer from starting the normal cartridge. Flash  mode  is  selected
    with a jumper.

    Register at $DE00:

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    Controls the GAME line: A 1 asserts the line, a 0  will  deassert
         it.
    1    Controls the EXROM line: A 0 will assert it, a  1  will  deassert
         it.
    2    Writing a 1 will disable further write accesses to all  registers
         of the Retro Replay, and  set  the  memory  map  of  the  C64  to
         standard, as if there is no cartridge installed at all.
    3    Controls bank-address 13 for ROM and RAM banking.
    4    Controls bank-address 14 for ROM and RAM banking.
    5    Switches between ROM and RAM: 0=ROM, 1=RAM
    6    Must be written once to "1" after a successful freeze in order to
         set the correct memory map and  enable  bits  0  and  1  of  this
         register. Otherwise no effect.
    7    Controls bank-address 15 for ROM banking.
@end example

    The register at $DE01 is the extended  control  register.  If  not  in
    Flash mode, bits 1, 2 and 6 can only be  written  once.  If  in  Flash
    mode, the REUcomp bit cannot be set, but  the  register  will  not  be
    disabled by the first write. Bit 5 is always set to 0 if not in  Flash
    mode.

    Register at $DE01:

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    Enable clockport connector.
    1    AllowBank (1 allows banking of RAM in $DF00/$DE02 area)
    2    NoFreeze (1 disables Freeze function)
    3    Bank-address 13 for RAM and ROM (mirror of $DE00)
    4    Bank-address 14 for RAM and ROM (mirror of $DE00)
    5    Bank-address 16 for ROM (only in flash mode)
    6    REU compatibility bit. 0=standard memory map, 1 = REU  compatible
         memory map
    7    Bank-address 15 for ROM (mirror of $DE00)
@end example

    Reading from the registers at either $DE00 or $DE01  will  return  the
    content of the status register.

    Status register:

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    1=Flashmode active (jumper set)
    1    feedback of AllowBank bit
    2    1=Freeze button pressed
    3    feedback of banking bit 13
    4    feedback of banking bit 14
    5    feedback of banking bit 16
    6    1=REU compatible memory map active
    7    feedback of banking bit 15
@end example

    The following memory maps are available:

@itemize @bullet
@item standard -
    $DE00 and $DE01 registers are active,  $DF00-$DFFF  contain  the  last
    page of the selected 8Kb bank  of  either  ROM  or  RAM,  whatever  is
    selected. RAM can only be accessed in $8000-$9FFF. ROM can  be  mapped
    to $8000, $A000 or $E000 with the corresponding  status  on  GAME  and
    EXROM.

    Note: If the AllowBank bit is  not  set,  the  $DF00-$DFFF  area  will
    always access bank 0 of the RAM, so the older  cartridge  images  will
    work. The AllowBank bit does not have any effect on the ROM mirror  in
    that area.

@item Freeze -
    ROM is mapped to $E000-$FFFF, bank 0 is active directly after  Freeze.
    Writing to bits 0 and 1 of the $DE00 register will have no  effect  on
    GAME and EXROM. RAM can be  selected  and  used  in  $DF00  or  $DE02,
    respectively, but not in $8000. Banking bits work, so  you  have  full
    read access to the ROM, and access to up to four RAM  pages  with  the
    AllowBank bit set (minus 2 bytes if REU compatible bit  is  set).  You
    should leave this memory map ASAP by setting bit 6 of  $DE00,  because
    C64 RAM in the $E000 area is not available, and you don't have control
    of the GAME and EXROM lines.

@item REU compatible -
    $DE00 and $DE01 registers are active, $DE02-$DEFF contain a mirror  of
    $9E02-$9EFF of the selected 8K-bank of either ROM or RAM, whatever  is
    selected. RAM can only be accessed in $8000-$9FFF. ROM can  be  mapped
    to $8000, $A000 or $E000 with the corresponding  status  on  GAME  and
    EXROM. The $DF00 stays free for use with the 1764 Ram  Expansion  Unit
    (REU).

    Note: If the AllowBank bit is  not  set,  the  $DE02-$DEFF  area  will
    always access bank 0 of the RAM, so the older  cartridge  images  will
    work. The AllowBank bit does not have any effect on the ROM mirror  in
    that area.

    The clockport registers  of  this  cart  can  be  switched  to  either
    $DE01-$DE0F or $DF21-$DF2F. The control  registers  are  available  at
    $DF10-$DF13.

    The register at $DE01 / $DF21 is write only:

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    7-1  Unused
    0    0 = disable clock port, 1 = enable clockport
@end example

    The registers at $DE02-$DE0F / $DF22-$DF2F are for the clock port  and
    are read/write.

    The register at $DF10 is the  MMC64  SPI  transfer  register,  a  byte
    written to this registers is sent to the card & response from the card
    is read here.

    The register at $DF11 is the MMC64 control register:

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    0 = MMC64 BIOS active, 1 = external ROM active
    1    0 = card selected, 1 = card not selected
    2    0 = 250khz transfer, 1 = 8mhz transfer
    3    0 = clock port @@ $DE00, 1 = clock port @@ $DF20
    4    0 = normal Operation, 1 = flash mode (*)
    5    0 = allow external rom when BIOS is disabled,
         1 = disable external ROM
    6    0 = SPI write trigger mode, 1 = SPI read trigger mode
    7    0 = MMC64 is active, 1 = MMC64 is completely disabled (**)
@end example

    (*) bit can only be programmed when flash jumper is set
    (**) bit can only be modified after unlocking

    The  register  at  $DF12  is  the  MMC64  status  register,  which  is
    read-only:

@example

    The register at $DF13 is the MMC64 identification register, which when
    reading from it can have the following values:

    $64 when bit 1 of $DF11 is 0.
    $01 when bit 1 of $DF11 is 1 and REV A hardware is used.
    $02 when bit 1 of $DF11 is 1 and REV B hardware is used.

    when writing to it it can be used to unlock  bit  7  of  $DF11  or  to
    re-enable the cart:

    Write $55 & $AA into this register to unlock bit 7 of $DF11.
    Write $0A & $1C into this register to re-enable MMC64 hardware.

    The cart uses the following registers:

    $DE00 - RR control register write

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    GAME line
    1    EXROM line
    2    1 = disable RR, bit can be reset by setting bit 6 of $DF12
    3    bank address 13
    4    bank address 14
    5    0 = rom enable, 1 = ram enable
    6    1 = exit freeze mode
    7    bank address 15
@end example

    $DE01 - extended RR control register write

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    0 = disable clockport, 1 = enable clockport
    1    0 = disable I/O RAM banking, 1 = enable I/O RAM banking
    2    0 = enable freeze, 1 = disable freeze
    3    bank address 13 (mirror of $DE00)
    4    bank address 14 (mirror of $DE00)
    5    0 = enable MMC registers, 1 = disable MMC registers. Can only  be
         written when bit 6 of $DF12 is 1. Register becomes effective when
         bit 0 of $DF11 is 1.
    6    0 = RAM/ROM at $DFxx, 1 = RAM/ROM at $DExx
    7    bank address 15 (mirror of $DE00)
@end example

    $DE02-$DE0F - Clockport memory area (when enabled)

    $DF10 - MMC SPI transfer register, a byte written is sent to the  card
            & response from the card is read here.

    $DF11 - MMC control register

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    0 = MMC BIOS enabled, 1 = MMC BIOS disabled.  Enabling  MMC  BIOS
         sets ROM banking to the last 64Kb bank.
    1    0 = card selected, 1 = card not selected. This bit also  controls
         the green activity LED.
    2    0 = 250khz transfer, 1 = 8mhz transfer
    3    ALWAYS 0
    4    ALWAYS 0
    5    (in RR-Mode:)
          0 = allow RR rom when MMC BIOS disabled , 1 = disable RR ROM
          (in mmcreplay bios mode:)
          RAM banking (0 = $E000 - $FFFF, 1 = $8000 - $9FFF)
          (in 16K mode:)
          enable RAM at $A000 - $BFFF
    6    0 = SPI write trigger mode, 1 = SPI read trigger mode
    7    ALWAYS 0
@end example

    $DF12 - MMC status register

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    0 = SPI ready, 1 = SPI busy (read)
                        1 = forbid ROM  write  accesses  (write).  Setting
                        this bit will disable writes  to  ROM  until  next
                        reset
    1  feedback of $DE00 bit 0 (GAME)
    2  feedback of $DE00 bit 1 (EXROM)
    3  0 = card inserted, 1 = no card inserted
    4  0 = card write enabled, 1 = card write disabled
    5  EEPROM DATA line /  DDR  register.  Setting  DATA  to  "1"  enables
       reading data bit from EEPROM at this position.
    6  0 = RR compatibility mode, 1 = Extended mode
       Selecting RR compatibility mode limits RAM  to  32Kb  and  disables
       writes  to  extended  banking  register.  Selecting  Extended  mode
       enables full RAM banking and enables Nordic Power mode in RR mode.
    7  EEPROM CLK line
@end example


    $DF13 - Extended banking register
            Can only be read/written to when bit 6 of $DF12 is 1

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    bank address 16
    1    bank address 17
    2    bank address 18
    3    ALWAYS 0
    4    ALWAYS 0
    5    16K rom mapping
    6    1 = enable  RR  register.  Disabling  RR  register  disables  ALL
         ROM/RAM banking too.
    7    ALWAYS 0
@end example

    NOTE THAT THE MMC REPLAY EMULATION IS CURRENTLY INCOMPLETE AND CONSIDERED
    BROKEN.

    This cart has 32Kb of ROM and 8Kb of RAM, it uses I/O-1 as a mirror of
    the last page of cart RAM. It has the following registers in the I/O-2
    range:

    ROM config register at $DF00 (can only be written to):

@example
    bit  meaning
    ---  -------
    0    ?
    1    ? (write 1 to release freeze mode)
    2    ROM bank select
    3    write 1 to disable cartridge
    4-6  unused
    7    ?
@end example

    Note: if bit0, bit1, bit7 are all 0, then ultimax mapping is  selected
    and RAM is enabled at ROML, otherwise if bit 0 is 0, then 16Kb mapping
    is enabled, or if bit 0 is 1, then 8Kb mapping is enabled.

    RAM config register at $DF01 (read/write):

    If written value == last value - 1, then ultimax mapping  is  selected
    and RAM is enabled at ROML, if written value == last value +  1,  then
    ROM is enabled at ROML and exrom is deasserted (switch to either 8k or
    16k mapping)

    $DF02-$DFFF holds the last page of the first 8kb of the current bank.

    When the cartridge is active, ultimax  is  enabled  when  the  address
    being accessed is is the $E000-$FFFF range, so the ROM is  visible  at
    $E000, below is normal C64 RAM. The cart can be disabled by writing to
    either I/O-1 or I/O-2 range. When the freezer button is  pressed,  the
    cartridge will be enabled and an NMI will be triggered.

    When reading from  the  I/O-1  range  ROM  bank  0(/2)  is  mapped  to
    $8000-$9FFF and ROM bank 1(/3) is mapped to $A000-$BFFF. When  reading
    from the I/O-2 range the cart is disabled. When a  reset  happens  the
    ROM banks get switched and ROM bank 0(/2) is  mapped  to  $8000-$9FFF.
    When a freeze happens ROM bank 0(/2) is mapped to both $8000-$9FFF and
    $E000-$FFFF.

    Accessing I/O-1 (the software  uses  $DE00  only  it  seems)  disables
    cartridge ROM. A reset enables 8K game mode and the ROM bank is mapped
    to $8000. A freeze causes ROM to be mapped to $8000.

    This cart has 64Kb ROM (2 32Kb Eproms, mapped to $8000  and  $A000  in
    16Kb Game Mode), and 32Kb RAM (mapped to $8000 and $A000 in  16K  Game
    Mode). The cart has 1 (write-only)  bank  control  register  which  is
    located at $DE80 and mirrored throughout the $DE80-$DEFF range:

@example
    Bit 0: unused/don't care
    Bit 1: Bank select: 0=upper, 1=lower (not correct ?!)
    Bit 2: chip select 0
    Bit 3: chip select 1
    Bit 4: cartridge enable/disable: 0=enable, 1=disable
    Bits 5-7: unused/don't care
@end example

    Chip select combinations of 0/1 are:
@example
    00: Eprom "79"
    01: Eprom "ZS3"
    10: Ram
    11: empty space (reading returns VIC-II data)
@end example

    note: on the original hardware "disabling" the  cartridge  by  setting
          bit 4 of the control register does NOT prevent write accesses to
          the cartridge RAM!. So  to  actually  disable  the  RAM,  it  is
          suggested to write $FF to the register.

@end example

Cartridge hardware is designed around a 128Kb ROM (PROM or Mask ROM) which is
divided into 16 banks each of 8Kb. When adressing the onboard bank-switching logic
the requested ROM bank is mapped at address range $8000-$9fff (8Kb)

The cartridge PCB layout was cost-optimized for mass-production purposes.

The address-/data-lines and bank-switching logic uses the closest address-/data-lines
with shortest and most direct path/distance in order to avoid too much PCB re-routing
and keep production costs as low as possible.

This means that the respective address-/data-lines from the cartridge port
may not necessarily connect with the corresponding address-/data-line of
the ROM according to the official specs of the ROM.

This has over the years given some headaches and invalid dumps when cartridge
dumpers that wanted to dump the cartridge contents by de-soldering the ROM and
dumping it using an EPROM programmer/reader.

The image extracted from such an operation would need transformation according
to the actual cartridge PCB re-routing of address-/data-lines. Alternatively
one can make an adapter that implements this applied re-routing of the
address-/data-lines.

This mass-production cost optimization also results in an obscured bank-switching
address pattern/values more info on that later.

[HWrev1]: The original "Hugo" PCB [HWrev1] is labeled "HUGO Copyright 1990"
on both sides of the PCB.
PCB production date is stamped on the back og PCB in the format: "YYMM"
1Mbit 27C010 EPROM or PROM (typical Atmel)
"Hugo" PCB [HWrev1] contains the following discrete logic IC components:
74LS00N (DIP) and 74LS237N (DIP)
DIP pitch (pin spacing) 2.54mm (0.1 inch)
Assembly/production facilities: Philips, Strandlodsvej (Amager), Copenhagen, Denmark

[HWrev1] Bank-switching pattern:
In order for the rom contents to appear as a continuous memory layout the following
ROM bank-switching pattern must be applied by writing to adress 0xDE00:
Cartridge bank-switching values: 00 80 10 90 20 a0 30 b0 40 c0 50 d0 60 e0 70 f0
Writing the bank-switch value to any address in address-range 0xDE00-0xDEFF
will work.

[HWrev2]: Revised PCB [HWrev2] for SMD mount is labeled "SO-A4-1"
on both sides of PCB.
1Mbit Mask ROM (SOIC-32)
PCB contains the following discrete logic SMD IC components:
74HCT02T (SOIC-14) and 74HCT174T (SOIC-16)
SOIC (pitch) pin spacing 1.27mm (SMD mounted)
Assembly/production facilities: Sono Press, Germany.

[HWrev2] Uses alternative bank-switching pattern:
Writing *ANY* value to address 0xDE0y (offset y) will select ROM bank y
Cartridge still has 16 banks and the lower four bits in the address selects
the right bank. Hence the valid address range is 0xDE00-0xDE0F

@end example

the following is a quick overview of how the cartridge works, as its a bit
unusual and different from most other cartridges:

@example
- 27256 EPROM (32k)
- 7430 TTL
- MC6821
- 1 button (reset)

rom bank 0x00 - 0x03 (0x04) 8192* 4 32k mapped to e000
MC6821 registers mapped to io2 at dfc0..dfc4

- press reset and hold delete to get the main menu
- press reset and hold control to skip cbm80 check 
  (dont start additional cartridge)

- press RESTORE, then...
  - left arrow, return  show disk directory
  - delete, 1           load"*" from disk, run
  - f1/f2               ? (disk stuff?)
  - f3/f4               ? (disk stuff?)
  - f5/f6, q            enter monitor
  - f7/f8, 2            show drive error channel
  - control, cursor     back to basic

  - type "help" in basic to get a list of available commands

*** MC6821 Port usage

Port A (parallel cable to floppy drive):
dfc0 port a ddr
dfc1 port a (in/out)

Port B (controls banking)
dfc2 port b ddr ($7f)
dfc3 port b (out)

bit3    1 = rom at $e000 enabled, 0 = cartridge disabled
bit1-2  rom bank number

    This cartridge type is very similar to the Magic Desk cart type: ROM  memory
    is  organized  in  8Kb  ($2000)  banks  located  at  $8000-$9FFF.  Bank
    switching is done by writing the bank number to $DE00.

@section The PSID image format for ripped SID tunes

This section describes the SID file format used for SID tunes in the HVSC
(High Voltage SID Collection - http://hvsc.de). It is based mostly on
Michael Schwendt's document that describes the file format and the PSID v2NG
extensions described by Simon White and Dag Lem and was further extended by
Wilfred Bos (PSID v3/v4, RSID v3/v4) and LaLa (assembled most of the following text)
and last not least tweaked a bit by Groepaz to fit into the VICE documentation.

The original documentation maintained by the HVSC team can be found here:
 @uref{http://www.hvsc.de/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt}

SID files use the .sid file extension.

Since PSID v2 is simply an extension of PSID v1, PSID v2NG is an extension of
PSID v2, RSID is a restricted version of PSID v2NG, PSID v3/v4 and RSID v3/v4 are
extentions of PSID v2NG and RSID v2, all of the formats are discussed together
below. RSID in specific is discussed in detail under the 'magicID' field
description.

The information presented here targets programmers or other people with
reasonable background. It is not suitable for newbies who have never before
used a machine code monitor, a disassembler, or a hexadecimal editor.


@c @node FIXME
@subsection The SID file header v1

The detailed structure of the SID header looks like the following. Header
offsets are in hexadecimal notation. Other integer values are decimal unless
explicitly marked otherwise. Any stored integer values are in big-endian
format:

@example
+00    magicID: ``PSID'' or ``RSID''
@end example

This is a four byte long ASCII character string containing the value
0x50534944 or 0x52534944. 'RSID' (Real SID) denotes that the file strictly
requires a true Commodore-64 environment to run properly. 'PSID' files will
generally run trouble-free on older PlaySID and libsidplay1 based emulators,
too.

Some words about the Real C64 SID file format (RSID):

The RSID format was designed to contain tunes that are not PlaySID compatible,
but strictly require a real C64 environment to run. Tunes that are multi-speed
and/or contain samples and/or use additional interrupt sources or do busy
looping will cause older SID emulators to lock up or play very wrongly (if at
all).

By using the name RSID for such rips all existing SID emulators will reject
these tunes safely until they can be upgraded to cope with the additional
requirements.

Due to the nature of these tunes, every effort must be made to make sure they
are directly runnable on an actual C64 computer. As such the tunes will only
be presented with the default C64 power-on environment and expected to
configure and use all hardware appropriately.

RSID is based on PSIDv2NG with the following modifications:

@itemize
@item magicID = RSID
@item version = 2, 3 and 4 only
@item loadAddress = 0 (reserved)
@item playAddress = 0 (reserved)
@item speed = 0 (reserved)
@item psidSpecific flag is called C64BASIC flag
@end itemize

The above fields MUST be checked and if any differ from the above then the
tune MUST be rejected. The definitions above will force tunes to contain
proper hardware configuration code and install valid interrupt handlers.

See section "The SID file environment" below for the default C64 power-on
environment for each SID file format.

@example
+04    WORD version
@end example

Available version number can be 0001, 0002, 0003 or 0004. Headers of version 2, 3 and 4
provide additional fields. RSID and PSID v2NG files must have 0002, 0003 or 0004 here.

@example
+06    WORD dataOffset
@end example

This is the offset from the start of the file to the C64 binary data area.
Because of the fixed size of the header, this is either 0x0076 for version 1
and 0x007C for version 2, 3 and 4.

@example
+08    WORD loadAddress
@end example

The C64 memory location where to put the C64 data. 0 means the data are in
original C64 binary file format, i.e. the first two bytes of the data contain
the little-endian load address (low byte, high byte). This must always be true
for RSID files. Furthermore, the actual load address must NOT be less than
$07E8 in RSID files.

You must be absolutely sure what to enter here. There is no way to detect
automatically whether the first two bytes in a C64 data file are meant to be a
load address or some arbitrary bytes of code or data. Unless your C64 file is
not a normal binary file and thus has no load address in front, you need not
enter anything else than 0 here. The SID tune will not play if you specify a
load address which is present in the C64 file already.

Normal C64 binary data files have a load address in their first two bytes, so
they can be loaded to a pre-defined destination address by executing
LOAD"FILE",8,1, for instance. If a load address is explicitly specified in the
sidtune info file, some sidtune converters and utilities conjecture that the
C64 data don't have a load address in their first two bytes. Hence, the
explicit load address from the info file is moved in front of the C64 data to
create a valid C64 binary file which can be easily loaded on a C64, too. If
that C64 file were to be saved, it would contain two superfluous data bytes at
offset 2 if an original load address had been in the first two bytes of the
old file. This process of adding a duplicate load address can be repeated. The
file loader strips off the first two bytes (the used load address) and puts
the rest of the file contents (including the now obsolete load address at file
offset 2) into memory. If the new load address is the same than the old one
the two added bytes cause the whole data to be displaced by two bytes, which
most likely results in malfunctioning code. Also, superfluous bytes in memory
then can confuse disassemblers which start at the beginning of the file or
memory buffer.

@example
+0A    WORD initAddress
@end example

The start address of the machine code subroutine that initializes a song,
accepting the contents of the 8-bit 6510 Accumulator as the song number
parameter. 0 means the address is equal to the effective load address.

In RSID files initAddress must never point to a ROM area ($A000-$BFFF or
$D000-$FFFF) or be lower than $07E8. Also, if the C64 BASIC flag is set,
initAddress must be 0.

@example
+0C    WORD playAddress
@end example

The start address of the machine code subroutine that can be called frequently
to produce a continuous sound. 0 means the initialization subroutine is
expected to install an interrupt handler, which then calls the music player at
some place. This must always be true for RSID files.

@example
+0E    WORD songs
@end example

The number of songs (or sound effects) that can be initialized by calling the
init address. The minimum is 1. The maximum is 256.

@example
+10    WORD startSong
@end example

The song number to be played by default. This value is optional. It often
specifies the first song you would hear upon starting the program is has been
taken from. It has a default of 1.

@example
+12    LONGWORD speed
@end example

This is a 32 bit big endian number.

For version 1 and 2 and for version 2NG, 3 and 4 with PlaySID specific flag (+76)
set, the 'speed' should be handled as follows:

Each bit in 'speed' specifies the speed for the corresponding tune number,
i.e. bit 0 specifies the speed for tune 1. If there are more than 32 tunes,
the speed specified for tune 32 is the same as tune 1, for tune 33 it is the
same as tune 2, etc.

For version 2NG, 3 and 4 with PlaySID specific flag (+76) cleared, the 'speed'
should be handled as follows:

Each bit in 'speed' specifies the speed for the corresponding tune number,
i.e. bit 0 specifies the speed for tune 1. If there are more than 32 tunes,
the speed specified for tune 32 is also used for all higher numbered tunes.

For all version counts:

@itemize
@item A 0 bit specifies vertical blank interrupt (50Hz PAL, 60Hz NTSC), and a 1 bit
specifies CIA 1 timer interrupt (default 60Hz).
@item Surplus bits in 'speed' should be set to 0.
@item For RSID files 'speed' must always be set to 0.
@end itemize

Note that if 'play' = 0, the bits in 'speed' should still be set for backwards
compatibility with older SID players. New SID players running in a C64
environment will ignore the speed bits in this case.

WARNING: This field does not work in PlaySID for Amiga like it was intended,
therefore the above is a redefinition of the original 'speed' field in SID
v2NG! See also the 'clock' (video standard) field described below for 'flags'.

@example
+16    ``<name>''
+36    ``<author>''
+56    ``<released>'' (once known as ``<copyright>'')
@end example

These are 32 byte long ASCII character strings. Upon evaluating the header,
these fields may hold a character string of 32 bytes which is not zero
terminated. For less than 32 characters the string should be zero terminated.
The maximum number of available free characters is 32.

@example
+76    <data>
@end example

Version 1 of the SID header is complete at this point. The binary C64 data
starts here.

@c @node FIXME
@subsection The SID file header v2, v3 and v4

Version 2, 3 and 4 of the header incorporates the v1 header fields and provides
additional fields. Some of these are actually v2NG, v3 or v4 specific - those are
noted below.

@example
+76    WORD flags
@end example

This is a 16 bit big endian number containing the following bitfields:

@itemize
@item Bit 0 specifies format of the binary data (musPlayer):
  0 = built-in music player,
  1 = Compute!'s Sidplayer MUS data, music player must be merged.
@end itemize

If this bit is set, the appended binary data are in Compute!'s Sidplayer MUS
format, and does not contain a built-in music player. An external player
machine code must be merged to replay such a sidtune.

@itemize
@item Bit 1 specifies whether the tune is PlaySID specific, e.g. uses PlaySID
  samples (psidSpecific):
  0 = C64 compatible,
  1 = PlaySID specific (PSID v2NG, v3, v4)
  1 = C64 BASIC flag (RSID)
@end itemize

This is a v2NG and RSID specific field.

PlaySID samples were invented to facilitate playback of C64 volume register
samples with the original Amiga PlaySID software. PlaySID samples made samples
a reality on slow Amiga hardware with a player that was updated only once a
frame.

Unfortunately, converting C64 volume samples to PlaySID samples means that
they can no longer be played on a C64, and furthermore the conversion might
potentially break the non-sample part of a tune if the timing between writes
to the SID registers is at all altered. This follows from the ADSR bugs in the
SID chip.

Today, the speed of common hardware and the sophistication of the SID players
is such that there is little need for PlaySID samples. However, with all the
PlaySID sample PSIDs in existence there's a need to differentiate between SID
files containing only original C64 code and PSID files containing PlaySID
samples or having other PlaySID specific issues. As stated above, bit 1 in
'flags' is reserved for this purpose.

Since RSID files do not have the need for PlaySID samples, this flag is used
for a different purpose: tunes that include a BASIC executable portion will
be played (with the BASIC portion executed) if the C64 BASIC flag is set. At
the same time, initAddress must be 0.

@itemize
@item Bits 2-3 specify the video standard (clock):
  00 = Unknown,
  01 = PAL,
  10 = NTSC,
  11 = PAL and NTSC.
@end itemize

This is a v2NG specific field.

As can be seen from the 'speed' field, it is not possible to specify NTSC C64
playback. This is unfortunate, since the different clock speeds means that a
tune written for the NTSC C64 will be slightly detuned if played back on a PAL
C64. Furthermore, NTSC C64 tunes driven by a vertical blank interrupt have to
be converted to use the CIA 1 timer to fit into this scheme. This can cause
severe problems, as the NTSC refresh rate is once every 17045 cycles, while
the CIA 1 timer A is latched with 17095 cycles. Apart from the difference in
timing itself, the SID ADSR bugs can actually break the tune.

The 'clock' (video standard) field was introduced to circumvent this problem.

@itemize
@item Bits 4-5 specify the SID version (sidModel):
  00 = Unknown,
  01 = MOS6581,
  10 = MOS8580,
  11 = MOS6581 and MOS8580.
@end itemize

This is a v2NG specific field.

@itemize
@item Bits 6-7 specify the SID version (sidModel) of the second SID:
  00 = Unknown,
  01 = MOS6581,
  10 = MOS8580,
  11 = MOS6581 and MOS8580.
@end itemize

If bits 6-7 are set to Unknown then the second SID will be set to the same SID
model as the first SID.

This is a v3 specific field.

@itemize
@item Bits 8-9 specify the SID version (sidModel) of the third SID:
  00 = Unknown,
  01 = MOS6581,
  10 = MOS8580,
  11 = MOS6581 and MOS8580.
@end itemize

If bits 8-9 are set to Unknown then the third SID will be set to the same SID
model as the first SID.

This is a v4 specific field.

The MOS6581 and the MOS8580 have three notable differences. First, combined
waveforms are generally louder on a MOS8580, to the extent that some
combinations that are clearly audible on a MOS8580 are completely silent on a
MOS6581. Second, the internal DC levels in the MOS8580 are so small that
software or hardware tricks must be used to play volume samples. Third, the
MOS8580 analog filter has totally different characteristics from the MOS6581
analog filter.

To ensure that music specifically written for one of the two SID versions can
be played back correctly, bits 4-9 in 'flags' are used as stated above.

@itemize
@item Bits 10-15 are reserved and should be set to 0.
@end itemize

@example
+78    BYTE startPage (relocStartPage)
@end example

This is a v2NG specific field.

This is an 8 bit number. If 'startPage' is 0, the SID file is clean, i.e. it
does not write outside its data range within the driver ranges. In this case
the largest free memory range can be determined from the start address and the
data length of the SID binary data. If 'startPage' is 0xFF, there is not even
a single free page, and driver relocation is impossible. Otherwise,
'startPage' specifies the start page of the single largest free memory range
within the driver ranges. For example, if 'startPage' is 0x1E, this free
memory range starts at $1E00.

@example
+79    BYTE pageLength (relocPages)
@end example

This is a v2NG specific field.

This is an 8 bit number indicating the number of free pages after 'startPage'.
If 'startPage' is not 0 or 0xFF, 'pageLength' is set to the number of free
pages starting at 'startPage'. If 'startPage' is 0 or 0xFF, 'pageLength' must
be set to 0.

The relocation range indicated by 'startPage' and 'pageLength' should never
overlap or encompass the load range of the C64 data. For RSID files, the
relocation range should also not overlap or encompass any of the ROM areas
($A000-$BFFF and $D000-$FFFF) or the reserved memory area ($0000-$03FF).

@example
+7A    BYTE secondSIDAddress
@end example

This is a v3 specific field. For v2NG, it should be set to 0.

This is an 8 bit number indicating the address of the second SID. It specifies
the middle part of the address, $Dxx0, starting from value $42 for $D420 to
$FE for $DFE0). Only even values are valid. Ranges $00-$41 ($D000-$D410) and
$80-$DF ($D800-$DDF0) are invalid. Any invalid value means that no second SID
is used, like $00.

@example
+7B    BYTE thirdSIDAddress
@end example

This is a v4 specific field. For v2NG and v3, it should be set to 0.

This is an 8 bit number indicating the address of the third SID. It specifies
the middle part of the address, $Dxx0, starting from value $42 for $D420 to
$FE for $DFE0). Only even values are valid. Ranges $00-$41 ($D000-$D410) and
$80-$DF ($D800-$DDF0) are invalid. Any invalid value means that no third SID
is used, like $00.
The address of the third SID cannot be the same as the second SID.

@example
+7C    <data>
@end example

Version 2, 3 and 4 of the SID header ends here. This offset is the start of the
binary C64 data. See also 'loadAddress' for what the first 2 bytes of 'data'
might indicate.

@c @node FIXME
@subsection The SID file environment

Before the data of a SID file is loaded in memory of a C64, certain addresses
and chips must be initialized in order to play the SID tune correctly.

For RSID and PSID files the following address must be set:

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .7
@item $02A6
@tab depending on the PAL/NTSC flag in the SID file header, it is set to
0x01 for PAL and set to 0x00 for NTSC.
@end multitable

The default C64 environment for PSID files is as follows:

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .7
@item VIC
@tab IRQ set to any raster value less than 0x100. Enabled when speed
 flag is 0, otherwise disabled.
@item CIA 1 timer A
@tab set to 60Hz (0x4025 for PAL and 0x4295 for NTSC) with the
counter running. IRQs active when speed flag is 1, otherwise
IRQs are disabled.
@item Other timers
@tab disabled and loaded with 0xFFFF.
@end multitable

When the init and play addresses are called the bank register value must be
written for every call and the value is calculated as follows:

@example
if   address < $A000  -> 0x37 // I/O, Kernal-ROM, Basic-ROM
else address < $D000  -> 0x36 // I/O, Kernal-ROM
else address >= $E000 -> 0x35 // I/O only
else                  -> 0x34 // RAM only
@end example

The default C64 environment for RSID files is as follows:

@multitable @columnfractions .3 .7
@item VIC
@tab IRQ set to raster 0x137, but not enabled.
@item CIA 1 timer A
@tab set to 60Hz (0x4025 for PAL and 0x4295 for NTSC) with the
counter running and IRQs active.
@item Other timers
@tab disabled and loaded with 0xFFFF.
@item Bank register
@tab 0x37
@end multitable

@itemize
@item A side effect of the bank register is that init MUST NOT be located under a
ROM/IO memory area (addresses $A000-$BFFF and $D000-$FFFF) or outside the
load image.

@item Since every effort needs to be made to run the tune on a real
C64 the load address of the image MUST NOT be set lower than $07E8.

@item If the C64 BASIC flag is set, the value at $030C must be set with the song
number to be played (0x00 for song 1).
@end itemize

You can find the latest news about VICE at the official VICE
home page:

VICE has moved its source repository to public services provided by
SourceForge. You can find it at
@example
@uref{http://sf.net/projects/vice-emu}.
@end example

We would like to thank the SourceForge staff for that help.

If you are going to report a bug, please check those pages @emph{first};
it is possible that the problem you encountered has already been
fixed with a newer version.

@section How to send feedback

Before contacting us, have a look at this manual and see if your question is answered
there. Keep in mind that we work on VICE in our spare-time, so the more
time we don't need to answer the same questions over and over again, the
more time we have to improve the emulation itself. On the other hand,
that does not mean that you should not contact us, especially if you
find bugs or have suggestions which might improve the emulation.

Bug reports, suggestions, support requests should be directed to the
SourceForge trackers at

@itemize @bullet

@item
@uref{http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=223021}.
@end itemize

This way, you, the users, and we, the developers, can track what has
been reported and what has been already fixed. Ideally, also sent the
report to the mailing address of the Vice team at

@itemize @bullet

@item
VICE Mailing List (@email{vice-emu-mail@@lists.sourceforge.net}) for all
general questions, bug reports, suggestions.

@end itemize

You can also contact (some of) us on IRC, at #vice-dev on freenode.

It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE, but
please read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the
team.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Please put the word @samp{VICE} @emph{in all capitals} in your subject
line (e.g., @samp{VICE fails to run game XXX}).  This helps mail
splitting and reduces chances that your message is unintentionally
deleted, forgotten or lost.

@item
Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  If you use
M$ Outlook or Netscape Communicator, make sure you turn off the
"rich text" (HTML) feature.

@item
Please don't send @emph{any} binaries without asking first.

@item
Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a bug
or a problem you cannot solve:

@itemize @bullet
@item
the VICE documentation (you are reading it!);
@item
the VICE FAQ (it is available on the Internet, and reachable from the
VICE home page:
@uref{http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net});
@item
the @code{comp.emulators.cbm} and @code{comp.sys.cbm} FAQs (@pxref{FAQs
you should read}).
@end itemize

@item
When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and
describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.  You should also
tell us what machine you are running on, what operating system you are
using as well as the version of it.

@item
Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to your
PC; this has been asked a gazillion times through email.  To transfer
disks, you can use the Star Commander
(@uref{http://sta.c64.org/sc.html}) on DOS, and OpenCBM
(@uref{http://www.trikaliotis.net/opencbm}) on Windows and Linux.  And
no, you cannot read C64 disks with your old 5"1/4 PC drive.

@item
Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the
Internet.

@item
Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we
really don't know.

@item
Please write in English.

@end itemize

In any case, we would be @emph{really} glad to receive your comments
about VICE.  We cannot always answer all the email, but we surely read
all of it.

Thanks!

@section How to contribute

If you want to make a major contribution, please @emph{ask} first.  It
has already happened a couple of times that somebody started working at
something that had already been done but not released to the public yet,
and we really do @emph{not} want anybody to waste time.

If you are going to make a patch, please make sure the patch is relative
to the very latest version, and provide us with the following:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Make sure you are giving us a diff against the latest Subversion
trunk version of VICE. For instructions on accessing the Subversion
repository, first read @uref{http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=223021} and
get it with the command:
@example
@samp{svn co https://vice-emu.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vice-emu/trunk vice-src}
@end example
@item
send a unified diff file against the trunk version of VICE (see above
bullet point) by using the command: @samp{svn diff} inside of the
SVN workspace you checked out before.

@item
If you cannot use SVN for one or the other reason, send a unified diff
file containing all the changes you have made @samp{diff -u};
please don't use plain @samp{diff}), as it adds much work for us to get
it working;
@item
GNU-style @file{ChangeLog} entries with a description of the changes you
have made (look at the @file{ChangeLog}s provided with the original VICE
sources for an example).
@end itemize

This is very important, and makes adding patches much smoother and
safer.

People willing to port VICE to other platforms are always welcome.
But notice from experience it will take at least a full year of
continuous work to write a well working and stable port.

@section Interesting newsgroups

There are some Usenet newsgroups you might be interested in:

@itemize @bullet

@item
@code{comp.emulators.cbm}, discussing about emulators of Commodore 8-bit
machines (definitely not Amiga emulators).

@item
@code{comp.sys.cbm}, discussing various topics regarding real Commodore
8-bit machines.  This newsgroup is mainly for people who actually use
original Commodore equipment (so please don't talk about emulation
here).

@item
@code{comp.emulators.misc}, discussing emulators in general.
