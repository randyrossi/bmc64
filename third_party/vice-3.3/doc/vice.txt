Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to
make sure the software is free for all its users.  This General Public
License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's software and
to any other program whose authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free
Software Foundation software is covered by the GNU Library General
Public License instead.)  You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.
You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.
And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the
Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
the Program (independent of having been made by running the
Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or
any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to
all third parties under the terms of this License.

c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply
to those sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But
when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on
the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees
extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
derivative or collective works based on the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a
volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other
work under the scope of this License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
following:

a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
software interchange; or,

b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with
such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source
or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless
that component itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated
so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License
to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject
to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted
herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third
parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive
copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely
from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
willing to distribute software through any other system and a
licensee cannot impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies a version number of this License which applies to
it and "any later version", you have the option of following the
terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version
published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program does not
specify a version number of this License, you may choose any
version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by
the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS
AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR

This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place - Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than 'show w' and 'show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
interest in the program `Gnomovision'
(which makes passes at compilers) written
by James Hacker.

SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program
into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you
may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications
with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library
General Public License instead of this License.

2 About VICE
************

VICE is the one and only "Versatile Commodore Emulator".  It provides
emulation of the Commodore C64, C64DTV, C128, VIC20, PET, PLUS4, SCPU64
and CBM-II computers within a single package.  The emulators run as
separate programs, but have the same user interface, share the same
settings and support the same file formats.

*Important notice:* If you have no idea what a Commodore 8-bit computer
is, or have questions about how these machines are used, how the file
formats work or anything else that is not strictly related to VICE, you
should read the appropriate FAQs _first_, as that kind of information is
not available here.  *Note Contacts::.  for information about how to
retrieve the FAQs.

All the emulators provide an accurate 6502/6510 emulator, with emulation
of all the opcodes (both documented and undocumented ones) and accurate
timing.  Unlike other emulators, VICE aims to be cycle accurate; it
tries to emulate chip timings as precisely as possible and does so
_efficiently_.

Please do _not_ expect the C64DTV, C128, PET, PLUS4, SCPU64 and CBM-II
emulators to be as good as the C64 or VIC20 one, as they are still under
construction.

_Notice:_ This documentation is written for the Unix release of VICE,
but is slowly being made universal.

2.1 C64 emulator features
=========================

As of version 2.3, two C64 emulators are provided: 'x64' (fast) and
'x64sc' (accurate).

The fast C64 emulator, called 'x64', features a fairly complete
emulation of the VIC-II video chip: sprites, all registers and all video
modes are fully emulated.  The emulation has been fully cycle-accurate
since version 0.13.0.

The accurate C64 emulator, called 'x64sc', features a cycle-based and
pixel-accurate VIC-II emulation.  This requires a much faster machine
than the old 'x64'.

A rather complete emulation of the SID sound chip is also provided.  All
the basic features are implemented as well as most of the complex ones
including synchronisation, ring modulation and filters.  There are two
emulators of the SID chip available: first is the "standard" VICE
emulator, available since VICE 0.12; the second is Dag Lem's reSID
engine.  The reSID engine is a lot more accurate than the standard
engine, but it is also a lot slower, and only suitable for faster
machines.

Naturally, also both CIAs (or VIAs, in some cases) are fully emulated
and cycle accurate.

2.2 C64DTV emulator features
============================

The C64DTV emulator, called 'x64dtv', features emulation of C64DTV
revisions 2 and 3.  The emulator is under construction, but most of the
DTV specific features are already supported (with varying accuracy).

Video cache is disabled by default as it currently doesn't work with
some of C64DTV's new video modes.  The new video modes have a simple
"fake" video cache implementation that may give incorrect results and
decreased performance.

2.3 C128 emulator features
==========================

The C128 emulator, called 'x128', features a complete emulation of the
internal MMU ("Memory Management Unit"), 80 column VDC screen, fast IEC
bus emulation, 2 MHz mode, Z80 emulation plus all the features of the
C64 emulation.

2.4 VIC20 emulator features
===========================

The VIC20 emulates all the internal hardware, including the VIA chips.
The VIC-I video chip is fully emulated except NTSC interlace mode, so
most graphical effects will work correctly.

Sound support is implemented, but is still at an experimental stage.  If
you think it could be improved and know how to do so, feel free to
contact us (*note Contacts::).

The VIC20 emulator now allows the use of the VIC1112 IEEE488 interface.
You have to enable the hardware (by menu, resource, or commandline
option) and then load the IEEE488 ROM (see for example
<http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/schematics/cartridges/vic20/ieee-488/325329-04.bin>,
but you have to double the size to 4k for now).  The IEEE-488 code is
then started by 'SYS45065'.

2.5 PET emulator features
=========================

The PET emulator emulates the 2001, 3032, 4032, 8032, 8096, 8296 and
SuperPET (MicroMainFrame 9000) models, covering the whole series.  The
hardware is pretty much the same in each and that is why one single
program is enough to emulate all of them.  For more detailed information
about PET hardware please refer to the 'PETdoc' file.

Both the 40 column and 80 column CRTC video chips are emulated (from the
4032 onward), but a few of the features are not implemented yet (numbers
of rasterlines per char and lines per screen).  Fortunately, they are
not very important for average applications.

Sound is available for the PET as well, but like the VIC20's it is still
under construction.

The PET 8096 is basically a PET 8032 with a 64k extension board which
allows remapping the upper 32k with RAM. You have to write to a special
register at '$fff0' to remap the memory.  The PET 8296 is a 8096 but
with a completely redesigned motherboard with 128k RAM in total.  Of the
additional 32k RAM you can use only some in blocks of 4k, but you have
to set jumpers on the motherboard for it.  VICE uses the command line
options '-petram9' and '-petramA' instead.  Also, the video controller
can handle a larger address range.  The PET 8x96 model emulations run
the Commodore LOS-96 operating system - basically an improved BASIC 4
version with up to 32k for BASIC text and 32k for variables.  See
'PETdoc' for more information.

The PET 8296D is an 8296 with built-in 8250 low-profile dual disk drive.

The PET 8296GD is an 8296D with additionally a "HiRes Emulator" (HRE).
This is a cheaper version of a "HRG" hi-res board which was based on
Thomson chips.  This version instead uses no additional hardware support
apart from some memory mapping tricks.  It has supporting software in
the hre-*.bin rom files.

The SuperPET also is a PET 8032 with an expansion board.  It can map 4k
at a time out of 64k into the '$9***' area.  Also it has an ACIA 6551
for RS232 communication.  The 6809 CPU that is built into the SuperPET
is now emulated, since release 2.4, including the 6702 dongle chip.

The Super-OS-9 MMU expansion, developed by TPUG (Toronto PET Users
Group) is also emulated.

The PET computers came with three major ROM revisions, so-called BASIC
1, 2 and 4, all of which are provided.  The PET 2001 uses the version 1,
the PET 3032 uses version 2, and the others use version 4.  The 2001 ROM
is horribly broken with respect to IEEE488 (they shipped it before they
tested it with the floppy drive, so only tape worked.  Therefore the
emulator patches the ROM to fix the IEEE488 routines.

As well as other low-level fixes the 2001 patch obtains the load address
for a program file from the first two bytes of the file.  This allows
the loading of both PET2001-saved files (that have $0400 as their load
address) and other PET files (that have $0401).  The PET2001 saves from
$0400 and not from $0401 as other PETs do.

Moreover, the secondary addresses used are now '0' and '1' for load and
save, respectively, and not arbitrary unused secondary addresses.

To select which model to run, specify it on the command line with the
'-model MODEL' option, where 'MODEL' can be one of a list of PET model
numbers, all described in *note PET model::

2.6 CBM-II emulator features
============================

The CBM-II emulator emulates several types of CBM-II models.  Those
models are known under different names in the USA and Europe.  In the
States they have been sold as 'B128' and 'B256', in Europe as 'CBM 610',
'CBM 620' (low-profile case) or 'CBM 710' and 'CBM 720' (high-profile
case with monitor).  In addition to that now an experimental C510
emulation is included.  The C510 (also known as P500) is the little
brother of the C600/700 machines.  It runs at roughly 1 MHz and,
surprise, it has a VIC-II instead of the CRTC. Otherwise the different
line of computers are very similar.

These computers are prepared to take a coprocessor board with an 8088 or
Z80 CPU. Indeed there are models 'CBM 630' and 'CBM 730' that supposedly
had those processors.  However these models are not emulated.

The basic difference is the amount of RAM these machines have been
supplied with.  The 'B128' and the 'CBM *10' models had 128k RAM, the
others 256k.  This implies some banking scheme, as the 6502 can only
address 64k.  And indeed those machines use a 6509, that can address 1
MByte of RAM. It has 2 registers at addresses 0 and 1.  The indirect
bank register at address 1 determines the bank (0-15) where the opcodes
'LDA (zp),Y' and 'STA (zp),Y' take the data from.  The exec bank
register at address 0 determines the bank where all other read and write
addresses take place.

The business line machines (C6xx/7xx) have the RAM in banks 1-2, resp.
1-4.  All available banks are used for BASIC, where program code is
separated from all variables, resp.  from normal variables, strings and
arrays that are distributed over other banks.  The C510 instead has RAM
in banks 0 and 1, and uses bank 1 for program and all variables.  Bank
0, though, can be accessed by the VIC-II to display graphics.

Many models have been expanded to more than the built-in memory.  In
fact some machines have been expanded to the full 1M. Bank 15 is used as
system bank, with only little RAM, and lots of expansion cartridge ROM
area, the I/O and the kernal/basic ROMs.  Some models have been modified
to map RAM into the expansion ROM area.  Those modifications can be
emulated as well.

The different settings are described in *note CBM-II model::.

2.7 SCPU64 emulator features
============================

The XSCPU64 emulator is a simulation of a C64 equipped with a SuperCPU64
V2B. Features:

* 20 MHz asynchronous single cycle 65816 CPU core with proper dummy
and invalid cycle handling.
* 128 KiB static RAM, 0-16 MiB SIMM RAM, 64-512 KiB EPROM emulated
and their respective timing details.
* All RAM optimization configurations supported with write buffer.
* I/O area access delays, write through to SRAM implemented.
* Memory mappings including cartridge and boot memory map and kernal
shadow.
* Hardware registers and switches implemented.
* Replacement SCPU64 ROM compatible with the original to avoid
distribution problems
* It's using the single cycle VICII core for accurate simulation

Still to do:

* Measure and verify VICII interrupt phase shift
* Measure and verify BA phase shift
* SIMM RAM extra 7.5 cycle refresh delay every 10us missing.
* CPU NMI support for "reset" button

The emulation is quite accurate but not perfect.  If you code something
timing intensive using this simulation please always check it on real
hardware to avoid bad surprises.

The hardware itself is asynchronous in nature, therefore caution must be
taken to not do long timing loops without synchronization in 20 MHz
mode.  Also don't squeeze out the last remaining cycles without leaving
a safety buffer.  Synchronization points can be created by doing I/O
reads or writes and leaving a few hundred cycles left each frame will
not hurt.

Otherwise it can happen that the code is running on this version of VICE
or my SCPU64 V2+C128D perfectly but nowhere else due to manufacturing
variations and frequency drifts.

2.8 The keyboard emulation
==========================

There are two ways of emulating the keyboard in VICE.

The default way ("symbolic mapping") is to map every key combination to
the corresponding key combination on the real machine: for example, if
you press <*>, which is bound to 'Shift-8' on a U.S. keyboard, in the
C64 emulator, the emulated machine will have just the _unshifted_ <*>
key pressed (as <*> is unshifted on the C64 keyboard).  Likewise,
pressing <'> on the same U.S. keyboard without any shift key will cause
the combination 'Shift-7' to be pressed in the emulated C64.  This way,
it becomes quite obvious what keys should be typed to obtain all the
symbols.

There is, however, one problem with symbolic mapping: some keys really
need to be mapped specially regardless.  The most important examples
being, in the VIC20, C64 and C128 emulators, that <CTRL> is mapped to
<Tab> and that the <Commodore> key is mapped to the left <Control>).
The <RUN/STOP> key is mapped to the <ESC> key on the PC keyboard.  The
PET emulator, lacking the <Commodore> key but having an <ESC> key, uses
the left <Control> key as <RUN/STOP> and the <ESC> key as <ESC> of
course.

The second way ("positional mapping") is to map every key on the "real"
keyboard to the key which has the same position on the keyboard of the
emulated machine.  This way, no <Shift> key is forced by the program
(with the exception of the function keys <F2>, <F4>, <F6> and <F8>,
which require <Shift> on the Commodore keyboards), and the keyboard is
more comfortable to use in those programs (such as some games) that
require the keys to be in the correct positions.

*Warning:* unlike the real C64, VICE "presses" the <Shift> key
_together_ with the key to shift when the <Shift> must be forced.  In
most cases this should work fine, but some keyboard routines are quite
picky and tend not to recognize the shift key because of this.  For
instance, 'F6' (which on the real C64 is obtained with 'Shift + F5')
could be recognized as 'F5'.  In that case, use the shift key manually
(i.e., type 'Shift + F5' in the example).  Yes, we know this is a bug.

The 'RESTORE' key is mapped to 'Page Up' (or 'Prev') by default.

2.9 The joystick emulation
==========================

Joysticks can be emulated both via the keyboard and via a real joystick
connected to the host machine (the latter only works on GNU/Linux
systems).

There are two keyboard layouts for joystick use, known as "numpad" and
"custom".

The "numpad" layout uses the numeric keypad keys, i.e., the numbers
<1>...<9> which emulate all the directions including the diagonal ones;
<0> emulates the fire button.

The "custom" layout uses the keys <w>, <e>, <r>, <s>, <d>, <f>, <x>,
<c>, <v> for the directions and <space> for the fire button instead.

2.10 The disk drive emulation
=============================

All the emulators support up to 4 external disk drives as devices 8, 9,
10 and 11.  Each of these devices can emulate virtual Commodore 1541,
1541-II, 1571, 1581, 2031, 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 8250 drives
in one of four ways:

* using disk images, i.e., files that contain a dump of all the
blocks contained in a real floppy disk (if you want more
information about what a disk image is, consult the
'comp.emulators.cbm' FAQ);
* accessing file system directories, thus giving you the use of files
without having to copy them to disk images; this also allows you to
read and write files in the 'P00' format (again, consult the
'comp.emulators.cbm' FAQ for more info).
* accessing a real device connected to the host machine.  As of VICE
1.11 it is possible to connect real drives like Commodore 1541 to
the printer port of the host using the XA1541 or XM1541 cable.
Currently this only works on Linux or Windows using the OpenCBM
library.  You can get it from
<http://www.lb.shuttle.de/puffin/cbm4linux> (cbm4linux, Linux
version) or from <http://cbm4win.sf.net> (cbm4win, Windows
version).

* directly using the disk drive of the host.  The 3.5" disk drive of
the host can be used to read or write Commodore 1581 formatted
disks.  Currently this raw drive access feature is only available
for Linux hosts.

When using disk images there are two available types of drive emulation.
One of them the "virtual drive" emulation.  It does _not_ really emulate
the serial line, but patches the kernal ROM (with the so-called "kernal
traps") so that serial line operations can be emulated via C language
routines.  This emulation is very fast, but only allows use of standard
DOS functions (and not even all of them).  For real device or raw drive
access it is required to enable this type of emulation.

The IEEE488 drives (2031, 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 8250) do not
use kernal traps.  Instead the IEEE488 interface lines are monitored and
the data is passed to the drive emulation.  To use them on the C64, you
need to enable the IEEE488 interface emulation.  Only if the IEEE488
emulation is enabled, those drives can be selected.

The other alternative is a "true drive" emulation.  The Commodore disk
drives are provided with their own CPU (a 6502 as the VIC20 and the
PETs) and their own RAM and ROM. So, in order to more closely emulate
its features, a complete emulation of this hardware must be provided and
that is what the "hardware level" emulation does.  When the "hardware
level" emulation is used, the kernal routines remain unpatched and the
serial line is fully emulated.  The problem with this emulation is that
it needs a lot of processing power, mainly because the emulator has to
emulate two CPUs instead of one.

The PETs do not use a serial IEC bus to communicate with the floppy
drive but instead use the parallel IEEE488 bus.  This does _byte by
byte_ transfers, as opposed to the _bit by bit_ transfers of the C64 and
VIC20, so making it feasible to emulate the parallel line completely
while emulating the drive at DOS level only.  The IEEE488 line
interpreter maps the drives 8-11 (as described above) to the IEEE488
disk units, and no kernal traps are needed.  The same emulation of the
Commodore IEEE488 bus interface is available for the C64 and the VIC20.
With IEEE488 drives you can have true 2031 emulation at unit #8, and
still have filesystem access at units #10 or #11, because monitoring the
IEEE488 lines does not interfere with the true drive emulation.

The IEEE488 disk drives 2040, 3040, 4040, 8050 and 8250 are Dual Drive
Floppy Disks.  This means that these drives handle two disks.  To
accomplish the emulation, only two disks can be emulated, namely units
#8 and #10.  The attached image, track display and LED display of unit
#9 and #11 are used for the second drive of the dual disk drives.  On
unix the unit number display (8 or 9, 10 or 11) in the emulation window
changes to the drive number display (0 or 1).

The Commodore 2040, 3040, 4040, 1001, 8050 and 8250 disk drives are
so-called "old-style" disk drives.  Their architecture includes not one,
but two processors of the 6502 type, namely a 6502 for the file handling
and communication with the PET (IP), and a 6504 (which is a 6502 with
reduced address space) for the drive handling (FDC). Both processors
communicate over a shared memory area.  The IP writes commands to
read/write blocks to this area and the FDC executes them.  To make the
emulation feasible, the FDC processor is not emulated cycle-exactly as a
6504, but simply by checking the commands and executing them on the
host.  This provides a fast FDC emulation, but disallows the sending the
FDC processor commands to execute code.  Applications where this is
necessary are believed to be rather seldom.  Only the format command
uses this feature, but this is checked for.

The dual disk drive 2040 emulates one of the very first CBM disk drives.
This drive has DOS version 1.  DOS1 uses an own disk type, that is
closely related to the 1541 disk image.  Only on tracks 18-24 DOS1 disks
have a sector more than 1541 disks.  DOS1 disk images have the extension
.d67.

The dual disk drives 3040 and 4040 use the same logical disk format as
the VC1541 and the 2031.  In fact, the 4040 was the first disk with DOS
version 2.  The 3040 emulated here originally was the same as 2040, only
for the european 30xx PET series.  As many of the original DOS1 disk
drives were upgraded (a simple ROM upgrade!)  to DOS2, I use the 3040
number for a DOS 2.0 disk drive, and 4040 for a revised DOS 2 disk
drive.  It is, however, not yet clear whether the disks here are write
compatible to the 1541, as rumors exist that the write gap between
sectors is different.  But read compatible they are.  As VICE emulates
the FDC processor in C and not as 6504 emulation, this does not matter
in VICE.

The drives 1001, 8050 and 8250 do actually have the very same DOS ROM.
Only the code in the FDC is different, which is taken care of by VICE.
So for all three of those disk drives, only 'dos1001' is needed.  The
DOS version used is 2.7.

2.11 Supported file formats
===========================

VICE supports the most popular Commodore file formats:

* 'X64' or 'D64' disk image files; Used by the 1541, 2031, 3040, 4040
drives.

* 'G64' GCR-encoded 1541 disk image files

* 'P64' lowlevel NRZI flux pulse disk image files

* 'D67' CBM2040 (DOS1) disk image format

* 'D71' VC1571 disk image format

* 'D81' VC1581 disk image format

* 'D80' CBM8050 disk image format

* 'D82' CBM8250/1001 disk image format

* 'D1M' FD2000/FD4000 DD disk image format

* 'D2M' FD2000/FD4000 HD disk image format

* 'D4M' FD4000 ED disk image format

* 'T64' tape container files (read-only)

* 'TAP' lowlevel tape image files

* 'P00' program files

* 'CRT' C64 cartridge image files

An utility ('c1541', *note c1541::) is provided to allow transfers and
conversions between these formats.

Notice that the use of the 'X64' file format is depreciated now.

You can convert an 'X64' file back into a 'D64' file with the UNIX 'dd'
command:

dd bs=64 skip=1 if=IMAGE.X64 of=IMAGE.D64

*Note File formats::.  for a technical description of the supported file
formats.

2.12 Common problems
====================

This section tries to describe the most common known problems with VICE,
and how to resolve them.

2.12.1 Sound problems
---------------------

VICE should compile and run without major problems on many systems, but
there are some known issues related to the sound driver.

If you are having sound problems, such as skipping, first monitor how
much CPU time the respective emulator is taking on your system.  To run
smoothly, on a modern system, it should really never go over 50% or so,
except for very short peaks that should also stay well beyond 90%.  If
you see it takes more, try disabling some of the most CPU intense
features (disable CRT emulation, use fastsid instead of reSID, disable
true drive emulation).

If the CPU usage is ok, try using a different sound driver.  You may
also try increasing the sound buffer size (although the default should
be ok for modern systems).

Linux, AIX and SGI systems should play sound without any problems; if
you are running Linux please use a 2.x kernel, as VICE needs some
features that were not implemented in older versions of the Linux sound
driver.

Windows should play sound ok.

macOS is currently untested.

All platforms that can run the SDL port (like Amiga, BeOS, etc) should
be able to play sound via SDL.

On the other hand, HP-UX and Solaris machines are known to cause
troubles.  If you think you can help debugging the code for these
systems, your help would be really appreciated.  We are having troubles
finding HP-UX and SUN consoles to work at...

Some problems have been reported with the proprietary version of the
Open Sound System for Linux.  With a Crystal sound card, sound output
was significantly delayed and, apparently, the allocated buffer size was
completely wrong.  This is not a VICE bug, but rather an OSS bug.

2.12.2 Video problems
---------------------

Due to the way VICE currently handles its main loop, a common problem
with video sync occurs when the real (the monitors) frame rate is very
close to, equal, or lower than the framerate of the emulated machine.
We recommend to use a framerate which is slightly higher than that (eg
51Hz for the C64).

2.12.3 Printer problems
-----------------------

VICE supports the emulation of a printer either on the userport or as
IEC device 4.  Unfortunately the Commodore IEC routines do not send all
commands to the IEC bus.  For example an 'OPEN 1,4' is not seen on the
IEC bus.  Also a 'CLOSE 1' after that is not seen.  VICE can see from
printing that there was an 'OPEN', but it cannot see when the close was.
Also a "finish print job" cannot be seen on the userport device.  To
flush the printer buffer (write to 'print.dump' or to the printer) now a
menu entry can be used.  Disabling and re-enabling the printer should
work as well.

The printing services have not been extensively tested but apart from
the problem mentioned above it should work fine now.

2.12.4 PET keyboard problems
----------------------------

If you find that the German keyboard mapping (plus German charset) does
not print uppercase umlauts, then you are right.  The umlauts replace
the [, and ] characters in the charset.  The keys that make these
characters do not have a different entry in the PET editor ROM tables
when shifted.  Thus it is not possible to get the uppercase umlauts in
the editor.  Nevertheless other programs are reported to change the
keyboard mapping table and thus allow the use of the shifted (uppercase)
umlauts.

Anyway, the VICE keyboard mappings are far from being perfect and we are
open to any suggestions.

3 Invoking the emulators
************************

The names of the available emulators are:

* 'vsid', the SID player

* 'x64', the fast C64 emulator

* 'x64sc', the accurate C64 emulator

* 'x64dtv', the C64DTV emulator

* 'x128', the C128 emulator

* 'xvic', the VIC20 emulator

* 'xpet', the PET emulator

* 'xplus4', the PLUS4 emulator

* 'xcbm2', the CBM-II emulator (CRTC models)

* 'xcbm5x0', the CBM-II emulator (VIC-II models)

* 'xscpu64', the SCPU64 emulator

You can run each of them by simply typing the name from a shell or by
configuring your window manager for example to use them to open disk
images.

If you want to look at the log output, or use the monitor in a port
which does not have a dedicated monitor UI yet, you should always run
them from a terminal window such as 'xterm' or 'rxvt'.  For example, you
could do

xterm -e x64sc

3.1 Command-line options used during initialization
===================================================

There are several options you can specify on the command line.  Some of
them are used to specify emulation settings and will be described in
detail later (*note Settings and resources:: for a complete list).  The
remaining options are used only to give usage information or to
initialize the emulator in some way:

'-help'
'-?'
List all the available command-line options and their meaning.

'-features'
List all compile time features

'-default'
Set default resources (*note Settings and resources::).  This will
override all the settings specified before, but not the settings
specified afterwards on the command line.

'-config <filename>'
Specify config file

'-dumpconfig <filename>'
Write the complete config into file.  Normally only resources that
have been changed from their default value would be written to the
config file, however with this option you can see all resources and
their current values.

'-logfile <name>'
Specify log file name ('LogFileName').

'-monlog <name>'
Specify log file name for the monitor.

'-verbose'
Enable verbose log output.

'-silent'
Disable all log output (except errors).

'-keybuf <string>'
Put the specified string into the keyboard buffer.

'-console'
Console mode (for music playback, or for running the emulator test
programs)

'-limitcycles <cycles>'
Automatically exit the emulator after a given number of cycles.

'-chdir <directory>'
Change the working directory.

'-autostart <name>'
Autostart <name> (*note Command-line autostart::).

'-autoload <name>'
Attach and autoload tape/disk image <name>

'-1 <Name>'
Attach <Name> as a tape image file.
'-8 <Name>'
'-9 <Name>'
'-10 <Name>'
'-11 <Name>'
Attach <Name> as a disk image to device 8, 9, 10 or 11.

'-attach8ro'
'-attach9ro'
'-attach10ro'
'-attach11ro'
Attach disk image for drive #8-11 read only
('AttachDevice8Readonly=1', 'AttachDevice9Readonly=1',
'AttachDevice10Readonly=1', 'AttachDevice11Readonly=1') (all
emulators except vsid).

'-attach8rw'
'-attach9rw'
'-attach10rw'
'-attach11rw'
Attach disk image for drive #8-11 read write (if possible)
('AttachDevice8Readonly=0', 'AttachDevice9Readonly=0',
'AttachDevice10Readonly=0', 'AttachDevice11Readonly=0') (all
emulators except vsid).

'-exitscreenshot <name>'
Specify name of a screenshot file that will be written when the
emulator exits.  ('ExitScreenshotName').

'-exitscreenshotvicii <name>'
Specify name of a screenshot file that will be written when the
emulator exits.  ('ExitScreenshotName1').  (x128)

3.2 Autostarting programs from the command-line
===============================================

It is possible to let the emulator "autostart" a disk or tape image
file, by simply specifying its name as the _last_ argument on the
command line, for example

x64sc lovelygame.d64

will start the C64 emulator, attaching 'lovelygame.d64' as a disk image
and running the first program on it.  You can also specify the name of
the program on the fisk image by appending a colon (':') the name itself
to the argument; for example

x64sc "lovelygame.d64:run me"

will run the program named 'run me' on 'lovelygame.d64' instead of the
first one.

Using the command-line option '-autostart' is equivalent; so the same
result can be obtained with

x64sc -autostart "lovelygame.d64:run me"

If you specify a raw CBM or P00 file, the emulator will setup the file
system based drive emulation so that it is enabled and accesses the
directory containing the file first.  This is a very convenient way to
start multi-file programs stored in file system directories and not
requiring "true" drive emulation.

*Note Disk and tape images::.  for more information about images and
autostart.

4 System files
**************

In order to work properly, the emulators need to load a few system
files:

* the "system ROMs", raw binary files containing copies of the
original ROMs of the machine you are emulating;

* the "keyboard maps", text files describing the keyboard layout;

* the "palette files", text files describing the colors of the
machine you are emulating.

* the "romset files", text files describing the different ROMs to
load.

The place where they will be searched for depends on the value of the
'Directory' resource, which is a colon (':')-separated search path list,
like the UNIX 'PATH' environment variable.  The default value is

PREFIX/lib/vice/EMU:$HOME/.vice/EMU:BOOTPATH/EMU

Where 'PREFIX' is the installation prefix (usually '/usr/local'), 'EMU'
is the name of the emulated machine ('C64', 'C64DTV', 'C128', 'PET',
'PLUS4', 'CBM-II', 'SCPU64' or 'VIC20') and 'BOOTPATH' is the directory
where the executable resides.  The disk drive ROMs are looked for in a
directory with 'EMU' set to 'DRIVES'.  '$HOME' is the user's home
directory.

For example, if you have the C64 emulator installed in

/usr/local/bin/x64

then the value will be

/usr/local/lib/vice/C64:$HOME/.vice/C64:/usr/local/bin/C64

And system files will be searched for under the following directories,
in the specified order:

1. '/usr/local/lib/VICE/C64'
2. '$HOME/.vice/C64'
3. '/usr/local/bin/C64'

System files can still be installed in a different directory if you
specify a complete path instead of just a file name.  For example, if
you specify './kernal' as the kernal image name, the kernal image will
be loaded from the current directory.  This can be done by using
command-line options or by modifying resource values (*note Resource
files::).

4.1 ROM files
=============

Every emulator requires its own ROM set.  For the VIC20 and the C64, the
ROM set consists of the following files:

* 'kernal', the Kernal ROM (8 KBytes)

* 'basic', the Basic ROM (8 KBytes)

* 'chargen', the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

The C128 needs the following files:

* 'kernal', the Kernal ROM (8 Kbytes)

* 'basic', the Basic + Editor ROM (32 Kbytes)

* 'chargen', the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

The C128, VIC20, SCPU64 and C64 emulators also need the following DOS
ROMs for the hardware-level emulation of the 1540, 1541, 1571, 1581,
2000 and 4000 disk drives:

* 'dos1540', the 1540 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

* 'dos1541', the 1541 drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

* 'dos1541II', the 1541-II drive ROM (16 Kbytes)

* 'dos1571', the 1571 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

* 'dos1581', the 1581 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

* 'dos2000', the 2000 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

* 'dos4000', the 4000 drive ROM (32 Kbytes)

In addition to those all emulators can handle a parallel IEEE488
interface (the C64 and C128 via '$df**' extension, the VIC20 via VIC1112
emulation) so they also need the DOS ROM for the IEEE disk drives:

* 'dos2031', the 2031 drive ROM (16 Kbytes) (DOS 2.6, Commodore ROM
images 901484-03 and 901484-05)

* 'dos2040', the 2040 drive ROM (8 Kbytes) (DOS 1, Commodore ROM
images 901468-06, 901468-07)

* 'dos3040', the 3040 drive ROM (12 Kbytes) (DOS 2, Commodore ROM
images 901468-11, 901468-12 and 901468-13)

* 'dos4040', the 4040 drive ROM (12 Kbytes) (DOS 2, Commodore ROM
images 901468-14, 901468-15 and 901468-16)

* 'dos1001', the 1001/8050/8250 drive ROM (16 Kbytes) (DOS 2.7,
Commodore ROM images 901887-01 and 901888-01)

Note that there are other DOS images on the internet.  The DOS 2.5
images might be used with the 8050, but it cannot handle the double
sided drives of the 1001 and 8250 and it is not supported by VICE.

The PET emulator uses an expanded setup, because there are three major
versions of the Basic and the Kernal, and many versions of the Editor
ROM. In addition there are cartridge ROM sockets.

The Kernal files contain the memory from range $F000-$FFFF, the Basic
ROMs either the range $C000-$DFFF or $B000-$DFFF. To handle the
different screen sizes and keyboards, different so-called "editor-ROMs"
for the memory range $E000-$E800 are provided.  The PET ROMs have the
following names:

* 'kernal1', the PET2001 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes) (Commodore ROM images
901447-06 and 901447-07)
* 'kernal2', the PET3032 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes) (Commodore ROM image
901465-03)
* 'kernal4', the PET4032/8032 Kernal ROM (4 KBytes) (Commodore ROM
image 901465-22)

* 'basic1', the PET2001 Basic 1 ROM (8 KBytes) (Commodore ROM images
901447-09, 901447-02, 901447-03, 901447-04.bin.  The -09 ROM is the
revised -01 ROM)
* 'basic2', the PET3032 Basic 2 ROM (8 KBytes) (Commodore ROM images
901465-01 and 901465-01)
* 'basic4', the PET4032/8032 Basic 4 ROM (12 KBytes) (Commodore ROM
images 901465-23, 901465-20 and 901465-21.  The -23 ROM is a
revised -19 ROM)

* 'edit1g', the PET2001 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901447-05)
* 'edit2b', the PET3032 editor for business keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901474-01)
* 'edit2g', the PET3032 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901447-24)
* 'edit4g40', the PET4032 editor for graphics keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901498-01)
* 'edit4b40', the PET4032 editor for business keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901474-02)
* 'edit4b80', the PET8032 editor for business keyboards (2 KBytes)
(Commodore ROM image 901474-04-?)

* 'chargen', the character generator ROM (2k).  It has two sets with
128 chars each.  The second (inverted) half of each set is computed
from the first half by inverting it.  This is a PET hardware
feature.  (Commodore ROM image 901447-10)
* 'chargen.de', the character generator ROM (2k).  This version is a
patched German charset, with the characters [,  and ] replaced by
umlauts.  It has been provided by U. Guettich and he reports that
it is supported by some programs.

* 'characters.901640-01.bin', the SuperPET character generator ROM
(4k).  The first half is the same as 'chargen', the second half
contains, instead of an upper and lower case set, an ASCII
character set and an APL character set.  For these sets, the screen
code is equal to the ASCII/APL code.
* 'waterloo-[abcdf]000.901898-0[1-5].bin',
'waterloo-e000.901897-01.bin'.  The Waterloo system ROMs.

* 'hre-9000.324992-02.bin' HiRes Emulator (at $9000) and
'hre-a000.324993-02.bin' HiRes BASIC (at $A000).  These are the two
roms for supporting the HRE on the 8296.  The ROMs are initialized
by the command 'SYS 36864'.

The PETs also have sockets for extension ROMs for the addresses
$9000-$9FFF, $A000-$AFFF and $B000-$BFFF (the last one for PET2001 and
PET3032 only).  You can specify ROM image files for those extensions
command line options '-petrom9', '-petromA' and '-petromB' resp.

An alternative would be to specify a long kernal ROM with the '-kernal'
option that includes the extension ROM areas.

Also, you can specify replacements for the basic ROM at $B000-$DFFF with
the '-petromBasic' option and for the editor ROM at $E000-$E7FF with the
'-petromEditor' option.

The CBM-II emulator again uses another setup.  For those models the
kernal used is the same for all.  However, for different amounts of
memory exist different versions of the BASIC ROMs.  The 128k RAM version
(C610, C710, B128) uses one bank of 64k for the BASIC text and another
one for all the variables.  The 256k RAM version uses one bank for text,
one for variables, one for arrays and one for strings.

Also the character generator ROMs have a format different from the
above.  The other character ROMs have 8 bytes of pixel data per
character.  Those ROMs have 16 bytes per character instead.  The C6x0
only uses the first 8 of it, but the C7x0 uses 14 lines per character
and needs those increased ROMs.  Both ROMs hold, like the PET, two
character sets with 128 characters each.  Again the second half of the
full (256 char) character set is computed by inverting.

* 'kernal', the KERNAL (8k) for the business machines (6xx/7xx)

* 'kernal.500', the KERNAL (8k) for the personal machine (510)
(901234-02)

* 'basic.128', the CBM-II 128k BASIC (16k)

* 'basic.256', CBM-II 256k BASIC (16k)

* 'basic.500', C510 BASIC (16k) (901236-02 + 901235-02)

* 'chargen.500', character generator ROM for the C5x0 (4k)
(901225-01)

* 'chargen.600', character generator ROM for the C6x0 (4k)

* 'chargen.700', character generator ROM for the C7x0 (4k)

The SCPU64 needs the following files:

* 'scpu64', the SCPU64 ROM (128 Kbytes)

* 'chargen', the character generator ROM (4 Kbytes)

4.2 Keymap files
================

"Keymap files" are used to define the keyboard layout, defining which
key (or combination of keys) must be mapped to each keysym.

In other words, the keyboard emulation works like this: whenever the
user presses or releases a key while the emulation window has the input
focus, the emulator receives an X-Window event with a value that
identifies that key.  That value is called a "keysym" and is unique to
that key.  The emulator then looks up that keysym in an internal table
that tells it which key(s) to press or release on the emulated keyboard.

This table is described by the keymap file, which is made up of lines
like the following:

KEYSYM ROW COLUMN SHIFTFLAG

Where:

* 'KEYSYM' is a string identifying the keysym: you can use the 'xev'
utility (shipped with the X Window system) to see what keysym is
bound to any key;

* 'ROW' and 'COLUMN' identify the key on the emulated keyboard;

* 'SHIFTFLAG' can have one of the following values:

* '0': the key is never shifted;

* '1': the key is shifted;

* '2': the key is the left shift;

* '4': the key is the right shift;

* '8': the key can be (optionally) shifted by the user.

The 'SHIFTFLAG' is useful if you want certain keys to be "artificially"
shifted by the emulator, and not by the user.  For example, <F2> is
shifted on the C64 keyboard, but you might want it to be mapped to the
unshifted <F2> key on the PC keyboard.  To do so, you just have to use a
line like the following:

F2 0 4 1

where '0' and '4' identify the key (row 0, column 4 on the keyboard
matrix), and '1' specifies that every time the user presses <F2> the
shift key on the C64 keyboard must be pressed.

There are also some special commands you can put into the keyboard file;
they are recognized because they start with an exclamation mark:

* '!CLEAR' clears the currently loaded keyboard map; it is necessary
to put this at the beginning of the file if you want the keymap
file to override all of the current internal settings;

* '!LSHIFT', '!RSHIFT', followed by a row and a column value, specify
where the left and right shift keys are located on the emulated
keyboard; for example, C64 default keymaps will specify

!LSHIFT 1 7
!RSHIFT 6 4

Any line starting with the '#' sign, instead, is completely ignored.
This is useful for adding comments within the keymap file.

VICE keymap files have the '.vkm' default extension, and every emulator
comes with a default positional mapping and a default symbolic mapping.

4.3 Palette files
=================

"Palette files" are used to specify the colors used in the emulators.
They are made up of lines like the following:

RED GREEN BLUE DITHER

where 'RED', 'GREEN' and 'BLUE' are hexadecimal values ranging from 0 to
FF and specifying the amount of red, green and blue you want for each
color and 'DITHER' is a 4-bit hexadecimal number specifying the pattern
you want when rendering on a B/W display.

You have to include as many lines as the number of colors the emulated
machine has, and the order of the lines must respect the one used in the
machine (so the N'th line must contain the specifications for color N -
1 in the emulated machine).

Lines starting with the '#' sign are completely ignored.  This is useful
for adding comments (such as color names) within the palette file.

For example, the default PET palette file (which has only two colors, 0
for background and 1 for foreground), looks like the following:

#
# VICE Palette file
#
# Syntax:
# Red Green Blue Dither
#

# Background
00 00 00 0

# Foreground
00 FF 00 F

4.4 Romset files
================

The Romset files are not used by default on all emulators.  You might
have recognized that the names of the ROM images are saved in resources.
Loading a Romset file now just means a 'shortcut' to changing all the
resources with ROM image names and reloading the ROMs.

The PET and CBM-II emulators use this feature to change between the
different ROM versions available for those machines.  E.g.  the Romset
file for the PET 2001 is

KernalName="pet2001"
EditorName=
ChargenName="chargen"
RomModule9Name=
RomModuleAName=
RomModuleBName=

As you can see, the file even uses the same syntax as the resource file,
it is just a bit stripped down.

While a Romset file is processed, the directory where the Romset file
was found is temporarily prepended to the search path ('Directory'
resource).  This also means that if you have a setting for 'Directory'
in it, its effect is limited to the Romset file itself.

4.4.1 Romset command line options
---------------------------------

'-romsetfile <File>'
load the given romset file

'-romsetarchive <File>'
load the given romset archive

'-romsetarchiveselect <Item number>'
select the given item from the current romset archive

5 Basic operation
*****************

This section describes the basic things you can do once the emulator has
been fired up.

5.1 The emulation window
========================

When the emulator is run, the screen of the emulated machine is
displayed in a standard X Window which we will call the "emulation
window".  This window will be updated in real time, displaying the same
contents that a real monitor or TV set would.

Below the emulation window there is an area which is used to display
information about the state of the emulator; we will call this area the
"status bar".

On the extreme left of the status bar, there is a "performance meter".
This displays the current relative speed of the emulator (as a
percentage) and the update frequency (in frames per second).  All the
machines emulated are PAL, so the update frequency will be 50 frames per
second if your system is fast enough to allow emulation at the speed of
the real machine.

On the extreme right of the status bar, there is a "drive status
indicator".  This is only visible if the hardware-level ("True") 1541
emulation is turned on.  In that case, the drive status indicator will
contain a rectangle emulating the drive LED and will display the current
track position of the drive's read/write head.

5.2 Using the menus
===================

It is possible to execute some commands and change emulation parameters
while the emulator is running: when the pointer is over the emulation
window, two menus are available by pressing either the left or right
mouse buttons.  The left mouse button will open the "command menu" from
which several emulation-related commands can be executed; the right
mouse button will open the "settings menu" from which emulation
parameters can be changed.  The basic difference between the command and
the settings menu is that, while commands have only effect on the
current session, settings can be saved and later used with the "Save
settings" and "Load settings" right-button menu items, respectively.
"Restore default settings" restores the factory defaults.  *Note
Settings and resources::.  for more information about how settings work
in VICE.

Sometimes commands can be reached via "shortcuts" or "hotkeys", i.e., it
is possible to execute them by pressing a sequence of keys instead of
going through the menu with the mouse.  Where shortcuts exist, they are
displayed in parentheses at the right edge of the menu item.  In VICE,
all shortcuts must begin with the <Meta> or <Alt> key.  So, for example,
to attach a disk image to drive #8 (the corresponding menu item displays
"M-8"), you have to press the <Meta> (or <Alt>) and then <8>.

Note that no other key presses are passed on to the emulated machine
while either <Meta> or <Alt> are held down.

5.3 Getting help
================

At any time, if you get stuck or do not remember how to perform a
certain action, you can use the "Browse manuals" command (from the help
menu).  This will open either the PDF or popup a browser and open the
HTML version of the documentation.

Notice that on Linux this requires VICE to be properly (and fully)
installed, eg with a 'make install'.

5.4 Using the file selector
===========================

In those situations where it is necessary to specify a file name, all of
the VICE emulators will pop up a file selector window allowing you to
select or specify a file interactively.

To the left of the file selector, there is a list of ancestor
directories: by clicking on them, you can ascend the directory tree.  To
the right, there is a list of the files in the current directory; files
can be selected by clicking on them.  If you click on a directory, that
directory becomes the current one; if you click on an ordinary file, it
becomes the active selection.

At the top, there is a "directory box", with the complete path of the
current directory, and a "file name box", with the name of the currently
selected file.  At the bottom there are two buttons: "OK" confirms the
selected file and "Cancel" abandons the file selector without cancelling
the operation.

It is also possible to specify what files you want to show in the file
selector by writing an appropriate shell-like pattern in the directory
box; e.g., '~/*.[dx]64' will only show files in the home directory whose
name ends with either '.d64' or with '.x64'.

5.5 Using disk and tape images
==============================

The emulator is able to emulate disk drives and tape recorders if
provided with suitable "disk images" or "tape images".  An "image" is a
raw dump of the contents of the media, and must be "attached" before the
emulator can use it.  "Attaching" a disk or tape image is like
"virtually" inserting a diskette or a cassette into the disk drive or
the tape recorder: once an image is attached, the emulator is able to
use it as a storage media.

There are five commands (in the left button menu) that deal with disk
and tape images:

* Attach Disk Image
* Detach Disk Image
* Attach Tape Image
* Detach Tape Image
* Smart-attach a file

The first four commands are used to insert and remove the virtual disks
and cassettes from the respective units.  On the other hand, the last
commands tries to guess the type of the image you are attaching from its
name and size, and attaches it to the most reasonable device.

Supported formats are 'D64', 'G64', 'P64' and the ancient 'X64' for disk
images (devices 8, 9 and 10) and 'T64' and 'TAP' for tape images.

Notice that 'T64' support is _read-only_, and that the cassette is
automatically rewound when you reach its end.  For actually emulating
tape, the 'TAP' format is highly recommended.

Another important feature is that raw Commodore BASIC binary files and
.P00 files can be attached as tapes.  As you can autostart a tape image
when it is attached (*note Autostart::), this allows you to autostart
these particular files as well.

You can attach a disk for which you do not have write permissions: when
this happens, the 1541 emulator will emulate a write-protected disk.
This is also useful if you want to prevent certain disk images from
being written to; in the latter case, just remove the write permission
for that file, e.g., by doing a 'chmod a-w'.

5.5.1 Previewing the image contents
-----------------------------------

It is possible to examine the directory of a disk or tape image before
attaching it.  Just press the "Contents" button in the file selector
window and a new window will pop up with the contents of the selected
image.

Notice that this function automatically translates the directory from
PETSCII to ASCII; but, due to differences in the two encodings, it is
not always possible to translate all the characters, so you might get
funny results when "weird" characters such as the semi-graphical ones
are being used.

5.5.2 "Autostarting" an image
-----------------------------

If you want to reset the machine and run the first program on a certain
image without typing any commands at the Commodore BASIC prompt, you can
use the "Autostart" button in the file selector window after selecting a
proper disk or tape image file.

Notice that, if true drive emulation is turned on, it will be turned off
before running the program and then turned on again after it has been
loaded.  This way, you get the maximum possible speed while loading the
file, but you do not lose compatibility once the program itself is
running.

This method is not completely safe, because some autostarting methods
might cause the true drive emulation not to be turned on again.  In such
cases, the best thing to do is to disable kernal traps (which will cause
true drive emulation to be always kept turned on), or to manually load
the program with true drive emulation turned on.

5.5.3 Using compressed files
----------------------------

It is also possible to attach disk or tape images that have been
compressed through various algorithms; compression formats are
identified from the file extension.  The following formats are supported
(the expected file name extension is in parenthesis):

* GNU Zip ('.gz' or '.z');
* BZip version 2 ('.bz2');
* PkZip ('.zip');
* GNU Zipped TAR archives ('.tar.gz', '.tgz');
* Zoo ('.zoo').

PkZip, 'tar.gz', 'lha' and 'zoo' support is _read-only_ and always uses
the _first_ 'T64' or 'D64' file in the archive.  So archives containing
multiple files will always be handled as if they contain only a single
file.

Windows and DOS don't contain the needful programs to handle compressed
archives.  Get gzip and unzip for Windows at
<ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/WIN32> and for DOS at
<ftp://ftp.freesoftware.com/pub/infozip/MSDOS>.  Don't use pkunzip for
DOS, it doesn't work.  The programs to use BZip2 archives may be found
at <http://sourceware.cygnus.com/bzip2>.  Just put the programs
(unzip.exe, gzip.exe, bzip2.exe) into a directory of your search path
(e.g.  C:DOS or C:WINDOWSCOMMAND; have a look at the PATH variable).

5.5.4 Using Zipcode and Lynx images
-----------------------------------

Since version 0.15, the VICE emulators have been able to attach disks
packed with Zipcode or Lynx directly, removing the need to manually
convert them into 'D64' or 'X64' files with 'c1541'.  This is achieved
by automatically invoking 'c1541', letting it decode the file into a
temporary image and attaching the resulting temporary image read-only.
For this to work, the directory containing 'c1541' must be in your
'PATH'.

This uses the '-unlynx' and '-zcreate' options of 'c1541' (*note c1541
commands and options::); these commands are not very reliable yet, and
could fail with certain kinds of Lynx and Zipcode images (for example,
they cannot deal with 'DEL' files properly).  So please use them with
caution.

Lynx files usually come as '.lnx' files which are unpacked into single
disk images.  On the other hand, Zipcode files do not have a particular
extension (although '.z64' is sometimes used), and represent a disk by
means of component files, named as follows:

* '1!NAME'
* '2!NAME'
* '3!NAME'
* '4!NAME'

If you attach as a disk image (or smart-attach) any one of these files,
the emulator will simply pick up the other three (by examining the name)
and then build a disk image using all four.

5.6 Resetting the machine
=========================

You can reset the emulated machine at any time by using the "Reset"
command from the command menu.  There are two types of reset:

* "soft reset", which simply resets the CPU and all the other chips;
* "hard reset", which also clears up the contents of RAM.

A "soft reset" is the same as a hardware reset achieved by pulling the
RESET line down; a "hard reset" is more like a power on/power off
sequence in that it makes sure the whole RAM is cleared.

It is possible that a soft reset may not be enough to take the machine
to the OS initialization sequence: in such cases, you will have to do a
hard reset instead.

This is especially the case for the CBM-II emulators.  Those machines
examine a memory location and if they find a certain "magic" value they
only do what you know from the C64 as 'Run/Stop-Restore'.  Therefore, to
really reset a CBM-II use hard reset.

6 Settings and resources
************************

In the VICE emulators, all the settings are stored in entities known as
called "resources".  Each resource has a name and a value which may be
either an integer or a string.  Integer values are often used as boolean
values with the usual convention of using zero for "false" and any other
value for "true".

Resource values can be changed via the right-button menu (the "settings"
menu), via command-line options or via the "resource file".

The "resource file" is a human-readable file containing resource values:
it is called 'vicerc' and is stored in the directory '.vice/' in the
user's home directory.  It is possible to dump the current values of the
resources into that file or load the values stored into that file as the
current values, at any time.  This is achieved with the "Save settings"
and "Load settings" right menu items.  A third menu item, "Restore
Default Settings", can be used to reset all the values to the factory
defaults.

A special resource, 'SaveResourcesOnExit', if set to a non zero value,
causes the emulator to ask you if you want to save the current (changed)
settings before exiting, and can be toggled with the "Save settings on
exit" command from the right-button menu.

Notice that not all the resources can be changed from the menus; some of
them can only be changed by manually modifying the resource file or by
using command-line options.

6.1 Format of resource files
============================

A resource file is made up of several sections; sections have the
purpose of separating the resources of a certain emulator from the ones
of the other emulators.  A section starts with the name of an emulator
in brackets (e.g., '[C64]') and ends when another section starts or when
the file ends.

Every line in a section has the following format:

RESOURCE=VALUE

where 'RESOURCE' is the name of a resource and 'VALUE' is its assigned
value.  Resource names are case-sensitive and resource values are either
strings or integers.  Strings must start and end with a double quote
character ('"'), while integers must be given in decimal notation.

Here is an example of a stripped-down '.vice/vicerc' file:

[VIC20]
SaveResourcesOnExit=0
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/vic20p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1
[C64]
SaveResourcesOnExit=1
FileSystemDevice8=1
FSDevice8ConvertP00=1
FSDevice8Dir="/home/ettore/cbm/stuff/c64p00"
FSDevice8SaveP00=1
FSDevice8HideCBMFiles=1

Notice that, when resource values are saved with "Save settings", the
emulator only modifies its own section, leaving the others unchanged.

6.2 Using command-line options to change resources
==================================================

Resources can also be changed via command-line options.

Command-line options always override the defaults from '.vice/vicerc',
and their assignments last for the whole session.  So, if you specify a
certain command-line option that changes a certain resource from its
default value and then use "Save Settings", the value specified with the
command-line option will be saved back to the resource file.

Command-line options can begin with with a minus sign ('-') or with a
plus sign ('+').  Options beginning with a minus sign may require an
additional parameter, while the ones beginning with the plus sign never
require one.

Moreover, options beginning with a plus sign always have a counterpart
with the same name, but with a minus sign; in that case, the option
beginning with a minus sign is used to _enable_ a certain feature, while
the one beginning with a plus sign is used to _disable_ the same feature
(this is an X11 convention).  For example, '-mitshm' enables support of
MITSHM, while '+mitshm' disables it.

6.3 Autostart settings
======================

6.3.1 Autostart resources
-------------------------

All these resources are available for all emulators except vsid.

'AutostartPrgDiskImage'
String specifying the filename of the disk image used when
autostarting a prg file and "copy to D64" is enabled (all emulators
except vsid).

'AutostartBasicLoad'
Boolean, if true load to basic start using ,8 when autostarting
(all emulators except vsid).

'AutostartRunWithColon'
Boolean, if true put a colon after the load command when
autostarting (all emulators except vsid).

'AutostartHandleTrueDriveEmulation'
Boolean, if true handle (enable/disable) True Drive Emulation on
autostart (all emulators except vsid).

'AutostartWarp'
Boolean, if true temporarily enable warp mode when autostarting
(all emulators except vsid).

'AutostartPrgMode'
Integer specifying the autostart mode for prg files (all emulators
except vsid).  (0: virtual filesystem, 1: inject to RAM, 2: copy to
D64)

'AutostartDelayRandom'
Boolean, enables a short (0-10 frames) random delay on autostart.
This is added to the 'AutostartDelay' (all emulators except vsid).

'AutostartDelay'
Integer specifying the delay in seconds required to wait for the
kernal reset routine before autostart.  (0: use builtin value for
standard kernal) When tweaking this value start with 'large' values
and then lower it, a value that is too small results in autostart
not happening.  (all emulators except vsid).  (0..1000)

6.3.2 Autostart command-line options
------------------------------------

All these command-line options are available for all emulators except
vsid.

'-autostartprgdiskimage <Name>'
Set disk image for autostart of PRG files ('AutostartPrgDiskImage')
(all emulators except vsid).

'-basicload'
On autostart, load to BASIC start (without ',1')
('AutostartBasicLoad=1') (all emulators except vsid).
'+basicload'
On autostart, load with ',1' ('AutostartBasicLoad=0') (all
emulators except vsid).

'-autostartwithcolon'
On autostart, use the 'RUN' command with a colon, i.e., 'RUN:'
('AutostartRunWithColon=1').  (all emulators except vsid)
'+autostartwithcolon'
On autostart, do not use the 'RUN' command with a colon; i.e.,
'RUN' ('AutostartRunWithColon=0') (all emulators except vsid).

'-autostart-handle-tde'
'+autostart-handle-tde'
Handle/Do not handle True Drive Emulation on autostart
('AutostartHandleTrueDriveEmulation=1',
'AutostartHandleTrueDriveEmulation=0') (all emulators except vsid).

'-autostart-warp'
'+autostart-warp'
Enable/disable warp mode during autostart ('AutostartWarp=1',
'AutostartWarp=0') (all emulators except vsid).

'-autostartprgmode <Mode>'
Set autostart mode for PRG files ('AutostartPrgMode') (all
emulators except vsid).  (0: virtual filesystem, 1: inject to RAM,
2: copy to D64)

'-autostart-delay-random'
'+autostart-delay-random'
Enable/disable random delay on autostart ('AutostartDelayRandom')
(all emulators except vsid).

'-autostart-delay <seconds>'
Set initial autostart delay in seconds for the kernal reset routine
before autostart.  (0: use builtin value for standard kernal).
When tweaking this value start with 'large' values and then lower
it, a value that is too small results in autostart not happening.
('AutostartDelay') (all emulators except vsid).  (0..1000)

6.4 Performance settings
========================

It is possible to control the emulation speed by using the "Maximum
speed" menu item in the right-button menu.  The default setting is
'100', which causes the emulation to never run faster than the real
machine.  A higher value allows the emulator to run faster, a lower one
may force it to run slower.  The setting "No limit" means to run as fast
as possible, without limiting speed.

It is also possible to control the emulator's rate of frame update using
the "Refresh rate" setting; the value ranges from "1/1" (update 1/1 of
the frames of the real machine, that is 50 frames per second) to "1/10"
(update 1 every 10 frames) and can be changed via the "Refresh Rate"
submenu.  The "Auto" setting means to dynamically adapt the refresh rate
to the current speed of the host machine, making sure the maximum speed
specified by the via "Maxium speed" is always reached if possible.  In
any case, the refresh rate will never be worse than 1/10 if this option
is specified.

Note that you cannot simultaneously specify "Auto" as the refresh rate
and "No limit" as the maximum speed..

Moreover, a special "warp speed" mode is provided and can be toggled
with the "Enable Warp Mode" menu item.  If this mode is enabled, it will
cause the emulator to disable any speed limit, turn sound emulation off
and use a 1/10 refresh rate, so that it will run at the maximum possible
speed.

6.4.1 Performance resources
---------------------------

'Speed'
Integer specifying the maximum relative speed, as a percentage.
'0' stands for "no limit".

'RefreshRate'
Integer specifying the refresh rate; a value of 'n' specifies a
refresh rate of 1/'n'.  A value of '0' enables automatic frame
skipping.

'WarpMode'
Booolean specifying whether "warp mode" is turned on or not.

6.4.2 Performance command-line options
--------------------------------------

'-speed <percent>'
Specifies the maximum speed as a percentage.  '0' stands for "no
limit" ('Speed').

'-refresh <value>'
Specifies refresh rate, a value of 'n' specifies a refresh rate of
1/'n'.  A value of '0' enables automatic frame skipping
('RefreshRate').

'-warp'
'+warp'
Enable/Disable warp mode ('WarpMode=1', 'WarpMode=0').

6.5 Video settings
==================

The following right-button menu items control the video output.  On
emulators that include two video chips (like 'x128') all options exist
twice, once for each chip.

* "Video Cache" enables a video cache that can speed up the emulation
when little graphics activity is going on; it is especially useful
when you run the emulator on a networked X terminal as it can
reduce the network bandwidth required.  However, this setting can
actually make the emulator slower when there is little graphics
activity and the amount of work needed to maintain the cache is
greater than the amount of work that would be wasted by not using
it (if any).

* "Double Size" toggles "double-size mode", which makes the emulation
window twice as big.  When emulating an 80-column PET, only the
height is doubled, so that the aspect ratio is closer to that of
the real thing.

* "Double Scan" toggles "double-scan mode", which causes the emulator
to draw only odd lines when running in double-size mode (this saves
some CPU time and also makes the emulation window look more like an
old monitor).

6.5.1 using openGL Rastersynchronization under X11
--------------------------------------------------

Warning: To get full retro experience with synchronization to the
vertrical raster retrace messing with X11 modelines (resolution and
refresh frequencies) is necessary.  This description is a suggestion -
Follow this instructions at your own risk!

The following was tested under Ubuntu Linux (8.04) featuring Xorg
Xserver 1:7.3+10ubuntu and mesa openGL including HW support (NVIDIA
driver) supporting glx version 1.4 supplying GLX_SGI_video_sync.

It is assumed that this works also on other systems supporting the
required extensions.

Preconditions:
* openGL extension GLX_SGI_video_sync in your X11 setup.  The
availability of the extension is checked at startup.

* XRandR extension to switch proper modes (50Hz for PAL, 60Hz for
NTSC) is mandatory, proper modelines in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
must be present.

If your systems lacks 50 or 60Hz modes you might try using 'gtf'
(typcally shipped with Xorg, xserver) - see related man page.

You might need to add the output such as:
# 800x600 # 50.00 Hz (GTF) hsync: 30.90 kHz; pclk: 31.15 MHz
Modeline "800x600_50.00" 31.15 800 824 904 1008 600 601 604 618 -HSync +Vsync
to you Monitor Section of /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add the resolution to
the 'Screen' section.

Sometimes some consistency checks within the display driver drop this
resolutions again.  To drop e.g.  the autodetection features in the
NVIDIA driver you might add 'Option "UseEDID" "FALSE"' in section
'Device'.

XRandR cannot cope properly with the DynamicTwinView feature of the
proprietary nvidia driver.  You might need

'Option "DynamicTwinView" "False"'

to get proper results (in Screen or Device section of you xorg.conf).

ATTENTION: Disabling such features might allow X11 to access your HW in
a way that it gets damaged!  You are at your own risk!

Enable fullscreen (not necessary, but makes sense):
* choose your preferred resolution/refresh XRandR Resolutions and
enable XRandR as fullscreen device (50Hz/PAL or 60Hz/NTSC mode).
* Activate fullscreen with 'Alt-D'.
* choose 'OpenGL Rastersynchronization' in the video chip menu
(VIC-II Settings, VIC Setting, etc.)

Note that:
* the current implementation is dropping synchronization silently in
case the display frequency isn't aligned (50Hz for PAL, 60Hz for
NTSC).

* On some systems the XRandR system isn't informed about desktop
display frequency changes if you switch resolutions via hotkeys
like CTRL-Alt-+ (Numpad), which is possible e.g.  with the X11
implementation of Xorg.

In that case you can override/tell the current frequency via menu:

6.8 Sound settings
==================

The following menu items control sound output:

* "Enable sound playback" turns sound emulation on and off.

* "Sound synchronization" specifies the method for syncronizing the
sound playback.  Possible settings are:
* "Flexible", i.e., the audio renderer flexibly adds/removes
samples to the output to smoothly adapt the playback to slight
changes in the speed of the emulator.
* "Adjusting" works like "flexible", but supports bigger
differences in speed.  For example, if the emulation speed
drops down from from 100% to 50%, audio slows down by the same
amount too.
* "Exact", instead, makes the audio renderer output always the
same sounds you would hear from the real thing, without trying
to adapt the ratio; to compensate the tolerances in speed,
some extra frames will be skipped or added.

* "Sample rate" specifies the sampling frequency, ranging from 8000
to 48000 Hz (not all the sound cards and/or sound drivers can
support all the frequencies, so actually the nearest candidate will
be chosen).

* "Buffer size" specifies the size of the audio buffer; the bigger
the buffer, the longer the delay with which sounds are played.  You
should pick the smallest value your machine can handle without
problems.

* "Sound suspend time", will cause the audio playback to pause for
the specified number of seconds whenever some clicking happens.  If
"Keep going" is selected, no pausing is done.

The following menu items control sound input:

* "Sampler Device" specifies the host device/method used for
sampling/sound input, currently portaudio (if linked in) and file
methods are supported.

* "Sampler Gain" specifies the amount of gain (increase the input
volume if above 100 or decrease the input volume if below 100) for
the input of the sampler device.

* "Sampler File" specifies the name of the file to be uses as an
input source for the 'file' method/device.

6.10 Drive settings
===================

These settings are used to control the hardware-level emulation of the
Disk drives.  When hardware-level emulation is turned on, only drives 8
and 9 are being emulated.

The following settings affect both drives:

* "Enable true drive emulation" enables the (slow) hardware-level
emulation of the drives for maximum compatibility.  This must be
turned on for any of the following settings to have effect.

* "Drive sync factor" specifies the speed of the drive's CPU. This
can be used to help loading certain programs that have trouble with
the default PAL setting (for example, programs designed for NTSC
machines).  The ratio is calculated as follows:

sync_factor = 65536 * clk_drive / clk_machine

where 'clk_drive' and 'clk_machine' are clock speeds in MHz.  The
menu lets you choose between the PAL and NTSC values, and also lets
you specify whatever value you want.  Be careful when changing it,
though, because a wrong value can break things and even corrupt
disk images.

The following settings, instead, are specific of each drive:

* "Drive model" specifies the model of the drive being emulated.
*Warning:* This will reset the drive.

* "Enable parallel cable" enables emulation of a SpeedDOS parallel
cable; if you switch this option on and replace the original
Commodore ROMs with SpeedDOS-compatible ones, you can speed up
loading/saving times.

* "Idle method" specifies which method the drive emulation should use
to save CPU cycles in the host CPU. There are three methods:

* "Skip cycles": Each time the serial line is accessed by the
C64, the drive executes all the cycles since the last time it
ran.  If the number of elapsed cycles is larger than a certain
value, the drive discards part of them.
* "Trap idle": The disk drive is still emulated upon serial line
accesses as with the previous option, but it is also always
emulated at the end of each screen frame.  If the drive gets
into the DOS idle loop, only pending interrupts are emulated
to save time.
* "No traps": Like "Trap idle", but without any traps at all.
So basically the drive works exactly as with the real thing,
and nothing is done to reduce the power needs of the drive
emulation.

The first option ("Skip cycles") is usually best for performance,
as the drive is emulated as little as possible; on the other hand,
you may notice sudden slowdowns (when the drive executes several
cycles at once) and the LED status is never updated (because it
would not be possible to do correctly so).  Moreover, if the drive
tries to get in sync with the computer in some weird way and the
computer does not access the serial line for a long time, it is
possible that some cycles are discarded and the sync is lost.
Notice that this hack will have no effect on performance if a
program continuously reads from the IEC port, as the drive will
have to be fully emulated in any case (some stupid programs do
this, even when they don't actually need to use the drive).

The second option ("Trap idle") is usually a bit slower, as at
least interrupts are always emulated, but ensures the LED state is
always updated correctly and always keeps the drive and the
computer in sync.  On the other hand, if a program installs a
non-standard idle loop in the drive, the drive CPU has to be
emulated even when not necessary and the global emulation speed is
then _much_ slower.

* "40-track image support" specifies how 40-track ("extended") disk
images should be supported.  There are three possible ways:

* "Never extend" never extends disk images at all (so if a
program tries to write tracks beyond the 35th, it is not
allowed to do so);
* "Ask on extend" prompts the user as soon as a program tries to
write tracks beyond the 35th, and the user can then choose
whether he wants the disk image to be extended or not;
* "Extend on access" simply extends the disk image as soon the
program needs it, without prompting the user.

6.11 Peripheral settings
========================

VICE is able to support some special peripherals:

* "file system devices", pseudo-drives accessing the Unix file
system;
* printers.

These features depend on some "kernal traps" that replace the existing
routines in the original Commodore operating system with custom-made C
routines.

6.11.1 Settings for file system devices
---------------------------------------

These settings deal with the drive-like peripherals connected to the bus
of the emulated machine.  The first setting relates to the parallel
IEEE488 interface.  With this interface a special engine is used to
listen to the bus lines to translates them to the filesystem code.  Thus
the PET will always detect a drive for example, but it can also use
drives 10 and 11 even together with true disk drive emulation.

* "Enable virtual devices", enables the peripheral access via the
fast disk emulation (either kernal traps or IEEE488 interface).
Both, filesystem and disk image access via fast drive emulation,
are affected.

Four peripherals, numbered from 8 to 11, are accessible; each of them
provides the following settings:

* "File system access", if enabled, allows the device to emulate a
drive accessing a file system directory; note that when a disk
image is attached to the same drive, the directory is no longer
visible and the attached disk is used instead.
* "File system directory" specifies the directory to be accessed by
the drive.
* "Convert P00 file names", if enabled, allows access to P00 files
using their built-in name instead of the Unix one.
* "Create P00 files on save", if enabled, creates P00 files (instead
of raw CBM files) whenever a program creates a file.

Note that, by default, all drives create P00 files on save.

6.11.2 Printer settings
-----------------------

The VICE emulators can emulate printers connected to either the IEC
buffer or the user port.  Emulation can be achieved by redirecting the
printer output to a file or by piping it through an external process.
This is defined by so-called "printer device file names"; a printer
device file name can be either a simple path, or a command name
preceeded by a pipe symbol '|'.

For example, printer device 'filename' will cause the output to be
appended to the file 'filename', while printer device '|lpr' will cause
the 'lpr' command to be executed and be fed the printer output.  The
printer output will not be converted but saved as printed by the
emulated machine.

Up to three printer devices may be specified through the following
resources:

* device 1, whose default value is 'print.dump';
* device 2, whose default value is '|lpr'.
* device 3, whose default value is '|petlp -F PS|lpr';

So, basically, by default printer device 1 will dump printer output to
'print.dump'; printer device 2 will print it via 'lpr' directly to the
printer and device 3 will print it via 'petlp' (a not-yet-complete
utility that will produce Postscript output from the Commodore printer
code) and then to the printer via 'lpr'.

If you have compatibility problems, you can completely disable Kernal
traps with the "Disable kernal traps" option.  This will of course
disable all the features that depend on it, such as the fast 1541
emulation (so you will have to turn true 1541 emulation on if you want
to be able to read or write disk images) and tape support.

6.12 RS232 settings
===================

The VICE emulators can emulate the RS232 device most of the machines
have.  The C64, C128 and VIC20 emulators emulate the userport RS232
interface at 300 and 1200 baud.  The C64 and C128 can also use the 9600
baud interface by Daniel Dallmann, using the shift registers of the two
CIA 6526 chips.  The PET can have a 6551 ACIA RS232 interface when
running as a SuperPET, and the CBM-II has such an ACIA by default.  The
C64 and C128 emulators can emulate an ACIA 6551 (also known as Datapump
for example) as extension at '$de**'.

Emulation can be achieved by either:

* connecting a real UNIX serial device;
* dumping to a file;
* piping through a process.

It is possible to define up to four UNIX serial devices, and then decide
which interface should be connected to which device.  This is done by
so-called "rs232 device file names"; an rs232 device file name can be
either a simple path, or a command name preceeded by a pipe symbol '|'.
If the path specifies a special device (e.g.  '/dev/ttyS0') it is
recognized by VICE and the emulator can set the baudrate.

For example, rs232 device 'filename' will cause the output to be written
(not appended) to the file 'filename', while printer device '|lpr' will
cause the 'lpr' command to be executed and be fed the rs232 output.  The
rs232 output will not be converted but saved as sent by the emulated
machine.  The same holds true for the rs232 input.  If the command
writes data to the standard output it will be caught by VICE and sent
back to the emulator.  Also the data sent by the pseudo device will be
sent back to VICE.

For example you can setup a null-modem cable between two serial ports of
your PC, setup one port for login and use the other in VICE. Then you
can login from your emulator via the RS232 emulation and the null-modem
cable to your machine again.

You can not simply run a shell from VICE, as the shell will notice that
it does not run on its own pseudo terminal and will thus buffer its
output.  You need to write some program that opens an own pseudo
terminal and runs the shell from there (not yet finished).

Up to four RS232 devices may be specified through the following
resources:

* device 1, whose default value is '/dev/ttyS0';
* device 2, whose default value is '/dev/ttyS1';
* device 3, whose default value is 'rs232.dump';
* device 4, whose default value is '|lpr'.

For the first two devices you can change the baudrate the tty device is
set to by specifying it on the commandline or in the menu.  This
baudrate is 9600 by default for the latter two, but can be changed only
by resources (The baudrate is independent from the baudrate the emulator
actually expects).

6.12.3 RS232 usage example
--------------------------

Here we give you a simple example how to set up an emulated C64 using
the modem connected to your PC. The following list shows each step.

'Attach your modem to your PC at a serial port.'
Normally you should set it up to use the modem as "/dev/modem".
'start VICE'

'Setup VICE to use your modem as "serial device 1"'
Go to the RS232 settings menu and change "Serial 1 device" to
"/dev/modem" (or the device where you attached your modem to) Then
go to the RS232 settings menu and change "Serial 1 baudrate" to the
baudrate your modem should run at.  Watch out, e.g.  on Linux there
is an additional multiplier to multiply with the baudrate (so e.g.
19200 gives 115200 or so baud) See the "setserial" manpage on Linux
for example.  However, most modems should be able to autodetect the
speed to the computer as well.

'Select the RS232 emulation your programs use'
If you want to use the Userport emulation, go to the RS232 settings
and change "Userport RS232 Device" to "Serial 1".  If you want ACIA
emulation (swiftlink or what's it called?)  then change "ACIA $DE**
device" to "Serial 1".

'Enable the emulation'
Go to the RS232 settings and select either "ACIA $DE** emulation"
or Userport 300/1200 baud or CIA 9600 baud emulation.

'Load your program and start it.'
If it is able to detect an RS232 cartridge like swiftlink or so,
try to detect the ACIA emulation if enabled.  Otherwise just set
the baudrate to either 300, 1200 or 9600 according to what you
enabled in the VICE menu for the userport.

7 Machine-specific features
***************************

7.1 C64/128-specific commands and settings
==========================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are C64/128 specific
and thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.1.1 Using cartridges
----------------------

The cartridge system is organized in "Slots" to allow more than one
cartridge connected at a time, like it can be done using an expansion
port expander on a real C64 (see below).

Generally a cartridge can be enabled by attaching its respective
cartridge image, or using the respective menu option for cartridges that
do not require an image.

x64, x64sc and x128 allow you to attach the following kinds of images:

* '.crt' images, as used by the CCS64 emulator by Per Hkan Sundell
* raw '.bin' images, with or without load address

"Cartridge images" are like disk images, but contain the contents of
cartridge ROM and/or RAM images instead of disk images.

To attach cartridges, use the "Attach a cartridge image" submenu.  When
using '.crt' images, this will work for every cartridge which is
supported.  For raw '.bin' images you might have to use command line
options.

When you have successfully attached a cartridge image, you should then
reset the machine to make sure the cartridge initializes itself.  (Or
enable the "reset on cartridge change" option).

Of course, it is also possible to detach a currently attached cartridge
image ("Detach cartridge image").

If you are using a freezer cart like an Action Replay cartridge, you can
emulate the cartridge's freeze button with the "Cartridge freeze"
command.

The imaginary expansion port expander is organized in 4 slots, the
cartridges are associated with them like this:

7.1.1.1 Slot 0
..............

All carts that have a passthrough connector go here.  Once a "Slot 0"
cartridge is enabled all further cartridges are connected to its
respective passthrough port.

Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.

"Slot 0" carts have individual "enable" switches, enabling means
enabling permanently.

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

* IEEE-488 Interface
(<http://www.funet.fi/pub/cbm/schematics/cartridges/c64/ieee-488/eprom.bin>)
* Magic Voice
* MMC64

7.1.1.2 Slot 1
..............

Mostly RAM based cartridges which for one reason or the other might make
sense to be enabled together with one of the "Main Slot" cartridges go
here.

Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.

"Slot 1" carts have individual "enable" switches, enabling means
enabling permanently

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

* Double Quick Brown Box (DQBB)
* Expert Cartridge
* ISEPIC
* RamCart

7.1.1.3 Main Slot
.................

All other cartridges which are not pure i/o extensions go here.

Only one cartridge of this type can be active at a time.

Cartridges in the "Main Slot" must be explicitly set as default to
enable them permanently.

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

* generic 4K, 8K and 16K game- and ultimax cartridges
* Action Replay V5
* Action Replay MK2
* Action Replay MK3
* Action Replay MK4
* Atomic Power
* C64 Games System
* Capture

* IDE64 (<http://www.ide64.org>)
* KCS Power Cartridge
* MACH 5
* Magic Desk
* Magic Formel
* Mikro Assembler
* MMC Replay
* Ocean
* Prophet64
* REX 256k EPROM Cart
* REX Utility
* Retro Replay
* RGCD
* RR-Net MK3
* ROSS
* Simons' BASIC
* Snapshot 64
* Stardos
* Structured BASIC
* Super Explode V5.0
* Super Games
* Super Snapshot V4
* Super Snapshot V5
* Warp Speed
* Westermann Learning
* Zaxxon

7.1.1.4 I/O Slot
................

All carts that are pure I/O extensions go here.

Any number of "I/O Slot" Carts may be active at a time.

"I/O Slot" carts have individual "enable" switches, enabling means
enabling permanently.

The following cartridges are emulated in this slot:

* ACIA (Swiftlink, Turbo232)
* DigiMAX
* DS12C887 RTC
* Ethernet (The Final Ethernet, RR-Net)
* GEO-RAM
* MIDI (Passport/Syntech, Datel/Siel/JMS/C-Lab, Maplin, Namesoft,
Sequential)
* RAM Expansion Module (REU)
* SFX Sound Expander
* SFX Sound Sampler

7.1.1.5 Expected behaviour
..........................

When the emulator is run without arguments, all settings from the config
file should be applied and arguments override settings from the config
file.

When saving the settings to the config file it is expected that on the
next run of the emulator all settings will be in the same state as they
were when saved.

There is an exception to this rule: the cartridge in the "Main Slot"
must be explicitly set as default before it gets saved to the config
file.

'+cart' should disable ALL cartridges, including eventually activated
REU, Swithlink and all similar expansionport devices.

'-cartXYZ' options should generally attach AND activate a cart of type
XYZ. As a consequence, attaching carts this way which are NOT in the
"Main Slot" will also enable the cart permanently.

7.1.1.6 Common problems
.......................

If attaching a cartridge does not work as expected, this may be because
of various reasons:

* Not seldomly the CRT type is incorrectly set in '.crt' files found
"in the wild".  Make sure this is not the case (if in doubt use
'cartconv' to verify and/or fix).

* You may have unintentionally enabled more than one cartridge at
once, for example by saving the settings with REU enabled, and then
later attaching a game cartridge from the command-line.  The
cartridge system will allow certain combinations, but (as on the
real thing) not all do (can) actually work.  To make sure this is
not the case, either detach all cartridges from the menus, or use
'+cart' on the command-line.

* The cartridge image might be broken.  Try one from a different
source.  If you are sure the dump is ok (for example because you
dumped it yourself) then make sure it is in proper linear order (on
some cartridges, for example "capture", address and/or data lines
at the eprom are shuffled around so a dump made with an eprom
burner can not be used as is).

* Last not least you might have encountered a bug in the emulation.
If you suspect this is the case, and you can still reproduce the
bug after checking the things above, please file a bug report
including the following information:

* attach your vicerc and a reference to the cartridge binaries
* if you can, comment in the respective DEBUGXYZ macros
prominently defined at the top of these files:
src/c64/cart/c64cart.c src/c64/cart/c64cartmem.c
src/c64/c64io.c src/c64/c64export.c and then recompile.  this
will add debug output that might make it much easier to locate
certain problems.

7.1.1.7 IEEE-488 interface
..........................

To be able to use an IEEE drive, you need to enable IEEE emulation for
the emulator.  To do this, follow the following steps:

Download the IEEE 488 ROM image from the CBM archives (formerly known as
FUNET) Attach that image with File/Attach cartridge image/IEEE488
interface image.

Make sure you have a one-drive system only (that is, go to
Settings/Peripheral Setting, uncheck "use IEC device" for all devices,
go to Settings/Drive Settings and select "Floppy type" as "none" for all
drives other than drive 8.

After this, all drives can be selected in x64 and x128.

7.1.1.8 The Final Cartridge 3
.............................

The Final Cartridge 3 detects whether a mouse is connected when it
starts and disables mouse support if it doesnt detect one.  So to make
mouse emulation work you must either enable it on the command line, or
reset the cartridge after enabling it from the user interface.

7.1.4 VIC-II settings
---------------------

These settings control the emulation of the VIC-II (MOS6569) video chip
used in both the C64 and the C128.

* "Sprite-sprite collisions" and "Sprite-background collisions", if
enabled, cause the hardware detection of sprite-to-sprite and
sprite-to-background collisions of the VIC-II to be emulated.  This
feature is used by many games, and disabling either of the two
detection systems can sometimes make you invincible (although there
is also a chance that also enemies become invincible then).

* "Color set" can be used to dynamically change the palette file
being used by choosing one of the available predefined color sets,
for example:

* 'pepto-pal.vpl' ("Pepto PAL"), a Palette calculated by Philip
"Pepto" Timmermann (<http://www.pepto.de/projects/colorvic/>).
(This is the default)
* 'vice.vpl' ("VICE"), the old default VICE palette.
* 'c64s.vpl' ("C64S"), palette taken from the shareware C64S
emulator by Miha Peternel.
* 'ccs64.vpl' ("CCS64"), palette taken from the shareware CCS64
emulator by Per Hkan Sundell.
* 'frodo.vpl' ("Frodo"), palette taken from the free Frodo
emulator by Christian Bauer (<https://frodo.cebix.net/>).
* 'pc64.vpl' ("PC64"), palette taken from the free PC64 emulator
by Wolfgang Lorenz.
* 'godot.vpl' ("GoDot"), palette as suggested by the authors of
the C64 graphics package GoDot (<https://www.godot64.de>).

7.1.5 SID settings
------------------

These settings control the emulation of the SID (MOS6581 or MOS8580)
audio chip.

* "Second SID" maps a second SID chip into the address space for
stereo sound.  This emulates e.g.  the "SID Symphony Stereo
Cartridge" from Dr.  Evil Laboratories.  The second SID can be used
with software such as "Stereo SID Player" by Mark Dickenson or "The
Enhanced Sidplayer" by Craig Chamberlain.

* "Second SID base address" sets the start address for the second SID
chip.  Software normally uses $DE00 or $DF00, since $DE00-$DEFF and
$DF00-$DFFF can be mapped through the cartridge port of the C64.
The default start address is $DE00.

* "Emulate filters" causes the built-in programmable filters of the
SID chip to be emulated.  A lot of C64 music requires them to be
emulated properly, but their emulation requires some additional
processor power.

* "ChipModel" specifies the model of the SID chip being emulated:
there are two slightly different generations of SID chips: MOS6581
ones and MOS8580 ones.

* "Use reSID emulation" specifies whether the more accurate (and
resource hungry) reSID emulation is turned on or off.

* "reSID sampling method" selects the method for conversion of the
SID output signal to a sampling rate appropriate for playback by
standard digital sound equipment.  Possible settings are:
* "Fast" simply clocks the SID chip at the output sampling
frequency, picking the nearest sample.  This yields acceptable
sound quality, but sampling noise is noticeable in some cases,
especially with SID combined waveforms.  The sound emulation
is still cycle exact.
* "Interpolating" clocks the SID chip each cycle, and calculates
each sample with linear interpolation.  The sampling noise is
now strongly attenuated by the SID external filter (as long as
"Emulate filters" is selected), and the linear interpolation
further improves the sound quality.
* "Resampling" clocks the SID chip each cycle, and uses the
theoretically correct method for sample generation.  This
delivers CD quality sound, but is extremely CPU intensive, and
is thus most useful for non-interactive sound generation.
Unless you have a very fast machine, that is.

* "reSID resampling passband" specifies the percentage of the total
bandwidth allocated to the resampling filter passband.  The work
rate of the resampling filter is inversely proportional to the
remaining transition band percentage.  This implies that e.g.  with
the transition band starting at ~ 20kHz, it is faster to generate
48kHz than 44.1kHz samples.  For CD quality sound generation at
44.1kHz the passband percentage should be set to 90 (i.e.  the
transition band starting at almost 20kHz).

7.1.6 C64 I/O extension settings
--------------------------------

I/O extensions are (usually) cartridges which do not map into ROM space,
but use only the I/O space at address range $DE00 ... $DEFF and/or $DF00
... $DFFF.

Please use these extensions only when needed, as they might cause
compatibility problems.

The following I/O extensions are available:

* ACIA (Swiftlink, Turbo232)

* DigiMAX

* DS12C887 RTC

* Ethernet (The Final Ethernet, RR-Net)

* GEO-RAM

* MIDI (Passport, Datel, Maplin, Namesoft, Sequential)

* REU - The "RAM Expansion Module" extension emulates a standard
Commodore RAM Expansion Unit; this can be used with GEOS and other
programs that are designed to take advantage of it.  This currently
works only in the C64 emulator.

* SFX Sound Expander

* SFX Sound Sampler

7.3 C64DTV-specific commands and settings
=========================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are C64DTV specific
and thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.3.1 C64DTV ROM image
----------------------

The DTV has a 2MB Flash chip which contains the kernal, basic and
character set ROMs along with other data, such as games in the case of
the original C64DTV ROM.

The image file is a dump of the flash chip.  It is exactly 2MB (2097152
bytes).

If you do not have a suitable image file, an image using the C64 kernal,
basic and charset is automatically created.

If writing to the C64DTV ROM is enabled, the image file is rewritten
with the current data when exiting x64dtv.

Note that x64dtv tries to load the image file from the C64DTV directory
first, and if it isn't found there, x64dtv tries to load it from the
current directory.  If you do not have 'dtvrom.bin' in your C64DTV
directory and writing to DTV ROM is enabled, the 'dtvrom.bin' file is
created to the current directory.

NOTE: The original C64DTV ROM has somewhat distorted colors, normally
you should use a patched rom.

'-c64dtvromimage <name>'
Specify filename of the C64DTV ROM image ('c64dtvromfilename').

'-c64dtvromrw'
'+c64dtvromrw'
Enable/disable writing to C64DTV ROM image ('c64dtvromrw=1',
'c64dtvromrw=0').

The trueflashfs option is analogous to True drive emulation.  If
disabled, any file access to the flash filesystem (device 1) will go to
the local file system instead.

'-trueflashfs'
'+trueflashfs'
Enable/disable true hardware flash file system ('FlashTrueFS=1',
'FlashTrueFS=0').

'-fsflash <name>'
Specify the directory for the flash file system device
('FSFlashDir').

7.3.2 DTV revision
------------------

The DTV revision 2 has a bug in the Blitter.  Using revision 3 is
recommended.  Emulation of DTV revision 2 including Blitter bug is
intended for testing DTV software.

'-dtvrev <revision>'
Specify DTV revision ('DtvRevision').  (2: DTV2, 3: DTV3)

7.3.3 LumaFix
-------------

The PAL C64DTVs have wrong resistors in the video output circuit, which
causes incorrect luminances.  Several hardware solutions ("LumaFixes")
have been developed to fix this flaw.

The fixed video output is emulated by selecting "New Luminances".  The
unmodified C64DTV video output can be emulated with "Old Luminances".

The default setting is "New Luminances".

7.3.4 Userport
--------------

The C64DTV userport emulation currently supports three devices: Hummer
ADC, userport joystick and PS/2 mouse.

The joystick that controls either the Hummer ADC or userport joystick
can be selected using the same parameter or menu option.

While using the Hummer ADC, joystick UP and DOWN are mapped to the
Hummer buttons A and B respectively.  LEFT and RIGHT set the ADCs output
to 0 and 255.  Centering the joystick results in the ADC value of 128.

Currently the Hummer ADC and userport joystick are mutually exclusive.
This means that enabling one disables the other.  PS/2 mouse emulation
can be used simultaneously with either Hummer ADC or userport joystick.

'-hummeradc'
'+hummeradc'
Enable/Disable Hummer ADC ('HummerADC=1', 'HummerADC=0').

'-ps2mouse'
'+ps2mouse'
Enable/disable PS/2 mouse on userport ('ps2mouse=1', 'ps2mouse=0').

7.3.5 Debug
-----------

Debugging information on Blitter, DMA and Flash can be enabled with
command line parameters.  This can be useful for DTV software
development.

'-dtvblitterlog'
'+dtvblitterlog'
Enable or disable DTV Blitter log

'-dtvdmalog'
'+dtvdmalog'
Enable or disable DTV DMA log

'-dtvflashlog'
'+dtvflashlog'
Enable or disable DTV Flash log

7.3.6 Monitor DTV features
--------------------------

Currently the registers A, Y and X are registers R0, R1 and R2
regardless of the mapping, which can be seen and modified via the
registers ACM and XYM.

The monitor can access all 2MB of RAM and 2MB of Flash, but only 64 kB
at a time.  The 64kB bank can be selected with "bank ram00".."ram1f" for
RAM and "bank rom00".."rom1f" for Flash.

The "load" command can load large files (>64kB) correctly if the bank is
set to "ramXX", where XX is the starting bank (usually "bank00").

7.5 VIC20-specific commands and settings
========================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are VIC20-specific and
thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.5.1 Using cartridge images
----------------------------

As with the C64 (*note C64 cartridges::), it is possible to attach
several types of cartridge images:

* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $2000;
* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $4000;
* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $6000;
* 4 or 8 Kbyte cartridges located at $A000;
* 4 Kbyte cartridges located at $B000.

This can all be done via the "Attach cartridge image..." command in the
left-button menu.  It is also possible to let xvic "guess" the type of
cartridge using "Smart-attach cartridge image...".

Notice that several cartridges are actually made up of two pieces (and
two files), that need to be loaded separately at different addresses.
In that case, you have to know the addresses (which are usually
specified in the file name) and use the "attach" command twice.

A special kind of cartridge file is where the two files mentioned above
are concatenated (with removing the two byte load address of the second
image) into one 16k image.  There are only few of those images, though.
Normally the second part is located at $A000.  Vice can now attach such
concatenated files at the start address $2000, $4000, and $6000.  The
second half of such an image is moved to $A000.  If you encounter 16k
images that have the second half not at $A000 you can split the image
into two halfs (i.e.  one 8194 byte and one 8192 byte, because the first
has the load address) and attach both files separately.

One cartridge that is currently only partially supported here is the
VIC1112 IEEE488 interface.  You have to load the ROM as a cartridge, but
you also have to enable the IEEE488 hardware by menu.

7.5.4 Changing memory configuration
-----------------------------------

It is possible to change the VIC20 memory configuration in two ways: by
enabling and/or disabling certain individual memory blocks, or by
choosing one among a few typical memory configurations.  The former can
be done by modifying resource values directly or from the right-button
menu; the latter can only be done from the menu.

There are 5 RAM expansion blocks in the VIC20, numbered 0, 1, 2, 3 and
5:

* block 0 (3 Kbytes at $0400-$0FFF);
* block 1 (8 Kbytes at $2000-$3FFF);
* block 2 (8 Kbytes at $4000-$5FFF);
* block 3 (8 Kbytes at $6000-$7FFF);
* block 5 (8 Kbytes at $A000-$BFFF).

These blocks are called "expansion blocks" because they are not present
a stock ("unexpanded") machine.  Each of them is associated to a boolean
'RamBlockX' resource (where 'X' is the block number) that specifies
whether the block is enabled or not.

There are also some common memory configurations you can pick from the
right-button menu:

* no RAM expansion blocks at all;
* all RAM expansion blocks enabled;
* 3K expansion (only block 0 is enabled);
* 8K expansion (only block 1 is enabled);
* 16K expansion (only blocks 1 and 2 are enabled);
* 24K expansion (only blocks 1, 2 and 3 are enabled).

7.5.4.1 VIC20 memory configuration resources
............................................

'RAMBlock0'
'RAMBlock1'
'RAMBlock2'
'RAMBlock3'
'RAMBlock5'
Booleans specifying whether RAM blocks 0, 1, 2, 3 and 5 must be
enabled.

7.5.4.2 VIC20 memory configuration command-line options
.......................................................

'-memory <config>'
Specify memory configuration.  It must be a comma-separated list of
options, each of which can be one the following:

* 'none' (no extension);
* 'all' (all blocks);
* '3k' (3k space in block 0);
* '8k' (first 8k extension block);
* '16k' (first and second 8k extension blocks);
* '24k' (first, second and 3rd extension blocks);
* '0', '1', '2', '3', '5' (memory in respective blocks);
* '04', '20', '40', '60', 'A0' (memory at respective address.

For example,

xvic -memory none

gives an unexpanded VIC20.  While

xvic -memory 60,a0

or

xvic -memory 3,5

enables memory in blocks 3 and 5, which is the usual configuration
for 16k ROM modules.

7.7 PET-specific commands and settings
======================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are PET-specific and
thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.7.1 Changing PET model settings
---------------------------------

With 'xpet', it is possible to change at runtime the characteristics of
the emulated PET so that it matches (or not) the ones of a certain PET
model, and it is also possible to select from a common set of PET models
so that all the features are selected accordingly.

The former is done by changing the following resources (via resource
file, command line options or right-menu items):

'RamSize'

7.7.7 Colour PET
----------------

The Colour PET is a simple extension by Steve Gray
<http://www.6502.org/users/sjgray/projects/colourpet/>.  It exploits the
similarities and differences between the 4032 and 8032 models, to use
memory at $8800 as colour RAM.

There are two versions of the extension:

with digital colour (RGBI), which can select 16 foreground and 16
background colours for each character cell.  The 8 colour bits are used
as RGBI RGBI, with the most significant bits for the background, and the
least significant bits for the foreground.

With analog colour, which can use 256 foreground colours for each
character cell, the 8 colour bits are used as RRR GGG BB.

7.7.8 Changing screen colors
----------------------------

It is also possible to choose what color set is used for the emulation
window.  This is done by specifying a palette file name (*note Palette
files::) in the 'PaletteName' resource.  The menu provides the following
values:

* 'green.vpl' (default, "green)"), the good old green-on-black
feeling;
* 'amber.vpl' ("amber"), an amber phosphor lookalike;
* 'white.vpl' ("white"), simple white-on-black palette.

7.7.9 DWW high resolution graphics
----------------------------------

The DWW, or Double-W (1), board is a high resolution graphics board for
PET models 30xx.  It attaches to the internal expansion connector.  It
would not physically fit in 20xx, 40xx or 80xx models because their
connectors are physically and logically different.  Apart from this, it
requires address space at $EC00-$EFFF, which makes it unfit to work in
40xx and 80xx models, which have only 256 bytes of I/O space at $E800.

The DWW board consists of 8 KB of RAM and a PIA to control various
options.  The RAM can be mapped either linearly at $9000-$AFFF, or
bank-switched in 8 banks of 8 KB each at $EC00-$EFFF.

It seems that in the demo programs, the BASIC versions like to POKE in
60200, where the machine language programs use $EB00.
60200 Port A or DDR A           $EB28
$EBx0 1  0       2  1 - RAM block at $EC00 (0-7)
4  2 /
8  3 charrom         0 = off 1 = on
16 4 hires           0 = on  1 = off
32 5 extra charrom   0 = on  1 = off

60201 Control Register A: bit #3 (worth 4) controls if 60200
$EBx1 accesses the Data Direction Register A (0) or Port A (1).

60202 Port B or DDR B
$EBx2 0 = RAM is visible from $9000 - $AFFF
1 = RAM is bank-switched in blocks of 1 K in $EC00 - $EFFF

[Control Register B is never mentioned, so putting 1 in this
address would access the DDR, creating an output line, which
after RESET is default 0...]

Typical initialisation sequence:
poke 60201,0        poke 60200,255          (all outputs)
poke 60201,4        poke 60200,24 or 25 (16 + 8 + 1)

Demo programs on disk PBE-110A, 110B, 111A, and 111B. (PBE = PET Benelux
Exchange, the Dutch PET user group)

The memory mapping is a bit strange.  It seems each 1 K block contains
the pixeldata for 1 bit-line of each text line.  This is probably so
that the addressing of the RAM can borrow part of the addressing
logic/signals of the text screen.  (The screen addressing cycles through
0-39, then increases the line (= byte offset) which is fetched from the
character ROM; for the graphics, the screen position selects the byte in
a KB and the char ROM offset selects which KB of graphics RAM).

My notes say: to set a pixel:
RE = INT(Y/8): LY = Y - 8*RE    (or Y AND 7)
BY = INT(X/8): BI = X - 8*BY    (or X AND 7)

when memory mapped to $9000:
L = 36864 + 1024 * LY + 40 * RE + BY
POKE L, PEEK(L) OR 2^BI

when memory mapped to $EC00:
POKE 60200,LY + 40 (or 8?)
L = 60416 + RE * 40 + BY
POKE L, PEEK(L) OR 2^BI

Unfortunately there is no logical means of expanding the memory to 16 K,
so even in an 80 columns PET the resolution will be the same.

7.7.10 HRE high resolution graphics
-----------------------------------

This information comes from Michal Pleban <kontakt@michau.name>,
<http://www.cbm-ii.com>.

This is a short information about the HRE (HiRes Emulator) graphics
board for PET 8296.  This is a small board that is installed on the
mainboard into sockets for the CRTC and character ROM. It adds the
ability to display 512x256 graphics on the built-in monitor.

The board is accompanied with two extension ROMs:

* 324992-02 HiRes Emulator (at $9000)
* 324993-02 HiRes BASIC (at $A000)

The ROMs are initialized by the command 'SYS 36864'.

After that, the computer recognizes additional BASIC commands like
DISPLAY, PLOT and so on; these commands are identical to those of the
HiRes Graphics boards based on Thomson chips.  All BASIC programs
written for the HRG boards should also work on the HRE (albeit much
slower).

Upon initialization, the ROM code writes some routines into expansion
RAM as $8800 - they are used to manipulate the bitmap data.  The actual
bitmap is located in expansion RAM at addresses $A000-$DFFF, and is
organized linearly (first 64 bytes form the first display line, then
comes the next line and so on).

The RAM is accessed for reading by writing the value #$83 into $E888.
This is a register in the CRTC memory space that is intercepted by the
board and serves as a latch to drive jumpers on the 8296D mainboard.
Because the ROMs are banked out this way, all video memory manipulation
must happen with interrupts disabled.  Normal ROM operation is restored
by writing #$0F into $E888.

As usual with the 8296, the RAM can also be written even when the ROMs
are mapped normally.

The board is initialized into graphics mode by modifying the following
values in CRTC registers (it is done by the routine located at $8C1A):

* Register $01 (horizontal displayed) = #$20
* Register $02 (horizontal sync position) = original + #$02
* Register $06 (vertical displayed) = #$20
* Register $07 (vertical sync position) = original + #$04
* Register $0C (RAM address high) = #$02

The last value causes the board to switch into graphics mode; former
values set up propoer screen dimensions for 512x256 display.

7.8 CBM-II-specific commands and settings
=========================================

This section lists the settings and commands that are CBM-II-specific
and thus are not present in the other emulators.

7.8.1 Changing CBM-II model
---------------------------

With 'xcbm2' and 'xcbm5x0', it is possible to change at runtime the
characteristics of the emulated CBM so that it matches (or not) the ones
of a certain CBM model, and it is also possible to select from a common
set of CBM models so that all the features are selected accordingly.

The former is done by changing the following resources (via resource
file, command line options or right-menu items):

'RamSize'
Size of memory in kByte.  xcbm2: (128, 256, 512, 1024) xcbm5x0:
(64, 128, 256, 512, 1024)

'Ram08'
Boolean specifying whether the RAM should be mapped to the
expansion ROM area at $0800-$0FFF or not.

'Ram1'
Boolean specifying whether the RAM should be mapped to the
expansion ROM area at $1000-$1FFF or not.

'Ram2'
Boolean specifying whether the RAM should be mapped to the
expansion ROM area at $2000-$3FFF or not.

'Ram4'
Boolean specifying whether the RAM should be mapped to the
expansion ROM area at $4000-$5FFF or not.

'Ram6'
Boolean specifying whether the RAM should be mapped to the
expansion ROM area at $6000-$7FFF or not.

'RamC'
Boolean specifying whether the RAM should be mapped to the
expansion ROM area at $C000-$CFFF or not.

'CartridgeReset'
Boolean specifying whether the machine should be reset when a
cartridge is changed.

'Cart1Name'
String specifying the filename for the $1000-$1FFF expansion ROM
file.  This file contains a 4k ROM dump.

'Cart2Name'
String specifying the filename for the $2000-$3FFF expansion ROM
file.  This file contains an 8k ROM dump.

'Cart4Name'
String specifying the filename for the $4000-$5FFF expansion ROM
file.  This file contains an 8k ROM dump.

'Cart6Name'
String specifying the filename for the $6000-$7FFF expansion ROM
file.  This file contains an 8k ROM dump.

'ModelLine'
The CBM-II business models have two hardcoded lines at one of the
I/O ports.  From those lines the kernal determines how it should
init the CRTC video chip for either 50Hz (Europe) or 60Hz (North
America), and either for 8 (C6x0) or 14 (C7x0) scanlines per
character.  xcbm2: (0: CBM 7x0 (50Hz), 1: 60Hz C6x0, 2: 50Hz C6x0)
xcbm5x0: (1: 60Hz C5x0, 2: 50Hz C5x0)

'ChargenName'
String specifying the name of the character generator ROM (default
for xcbm2: 'chargen.600', default for xcbm5x0: 'chargen.500').

'KernalName'
String specifying the name of the Kernal ROM (default for xcbm2:
'kernal', default for xcbm5x0: 'kernal.500').

'BasicName'
String specifying the name of the Basic ROM (default for xcbm2:
'basic.128', default for xcbm5x0: 'basic.500').

'MachineVideoStandard'
Integer that specifies the video standard of the emulated machine
(1: PAL, 2: NTSC).

Choosing a common CBM-II model is done from the right-button menu
instead, by choosing an item from the "Model defaults" submenu.
Available models are:

* C510 PAL or NTSC (128k RAM)
* C610 PAL or NTSC (128k RAM)
* C620 (256k RAM)
* C620+ (1024k RAM, expanded) PAL or NTSC
* C710 (128k RAM) NTSC
* C720 (256k RAM) NTSC
* C720+ (1024k RAM, expanded) NTSC

Notice that this will *reset the emulated machine*.

Warning: At this time the 5x0 and other machines are implemented in
different executables, so switching between those models is not
possible.

It is also possible to select the CBM model at startup, with the
'-model' command-line option: for example, 'xcbm2 -model 610' will
emulate a CBM 610 while 'xcbm2 -model 620' will emulate a CBM 620.

9 Snapshots
***********

Every VICE emulator has a built-in snapshot feature, that saves the
complete emulator state into one file for later use.  You can therefore
save the emulator state - including the state of the game you are
playing for example - in a single file.

9.1 Snapshot usage
==================

A snapshot is one file containining the complete emulator state.  A
snapshot file can be generated by selecting the "Save snapshot" command
at any time.  This will pop up a requester from which you can specify
whether the snapshot should also contain the disk and ROM status.

A snapshot file can be used to restore the emulator state by selecting
the 'load snapshot' menu entry at any time.  Unfortunately attached ROM
images/cartridges are only supported in the VIC20, the PET and the
CBM-II emulators at this time.

The memory configuration of the emulator is saved in the snapshot file
as well.  This configuration is restored when the snapshot is loaded.

A quick snapshot can now be made by pressing the 'M-F11' key and
reloaded by pressing the 'M-F10' key.

9.2 Snapshot format
===================

A snapshot file consists of several modules of mostly different types.
Each module has a name and saves the state of an entity like a CIA, the
CPU, or the memory.

9.2.2 Module formats
--------------------

This section shows the basic module framework and the contents of the
different types of modules.

The single chip modules contain the chip state, not the state of the
emulator.  We tried to make the format as implementation-independent as
possible, to allow reuse of snapshots in later versions of this
emulator, or even in other emulators.

9.2.2.1 Terminology
...................

In this section we use certain abbreviations to define the types of the
data saved in the snapshot.

'BYTE'
8 bit integer.
'WORD'
16 bit integer.  Saved with low-byte first, high-byte last.
'DWORD'
32 bit integer.  Saved with low-word first, then high-word.  Each
word saved with its low-byte first.
'ARRAY'
Array of BYTE values.  Length depends on the description.

The tables for the single modules state the type, name and description
of the data saved in the modules.  The data is saved in the order it is
in the tables, so no offset is given.

9.2.2.2 Module framework
........................

The VICE snapshot file starts with the magic string and includes the
fileformat version number.

Type    Name                          Description
19      MAGIC                         "VICE Snapshot File032", padded
BYTE                                  with 0
BYTE    VMAJOR                        fileformat major version number
BYTE    VMINOR                        fileformat minor version number
16      MACHINENAME                   Name of emulated machine, like
BYTE                                  "PET", "CBM-II", "VIC20", "C64" or
"C128".  zerobyte-padded.

The file header is followed by a number of different snapshot modules.

Each module has a header with the information given in the table below.
The header includes two version numbers, VMAJOR and VMINOR. Modules with
the same VMAJOR should be able to be exchanged.  I.e.  higher VMINOR
numbers only append to the data for lower VMINOR. This additional data
is ignored by older restore routines.  The other way around newer
restore routines must accept the fewer info from lower VMINOR dumps.
Changes in VMAJOR might introduce any incompatibility you like, but
that's what VMAJOR is for after all :-)

Type    Name                          Description
16      MODULENAME                    The name of the module in ASCII,
BYTE                                  padded with 0 to 16 byte.
BYTE    VMAJOR                        major version number
BYTE    VMINOR                        minor version number

The last two items have been added in CIA snapshot version 1.1 due to
the improved CIA emulation in the newer VICE versions.  Some state bits
correspond to the CIA state as described in the "A Software Model of the
CIA 6526" document by Wolfgang Lorenz, some are delayed versions.  For
more read the source file 'ciatimer.h'.

9.2.2.10 SID module

Warning: This module is still under construction.

9.2.2.11 ACIA module
....................

The ACIA 6551 is an RS232 interface chip.  VICE emulates RS232
connections via '/dev/ttyS*' (Unix) or 'COM:' (DOS/WIN - not yet?).
When saving a snapshot, those connections are of course lost.  The state
of the ACIA however is restored if possible.  I.e.  if a connection is
already open when restoring the snapshot, this connection is used
instead.  If no connection is open, a carrier/DTR drop is emulated.

Warning: After VICE version 1.0 the CRTC emulation has improved
considerably.  Especially it is now cycle exact.  Therefore a lot more
variables must be saved.  The snapshot module version jumped from 0.0 to
1.0.  Newer versions of VICE can read the old snapshots, but older
versions (1.0 and below) cannot read the new snapshots.

The PETDWW module

For storing the state of the DWW hires expansion board, there is a
PETDWWPIA module, and a DWWMEM module.

The former has the same format as the PIA1.

Type    Name                          Description

9.2.2.19 CBM-II memory module
.............................

The CBM-II memory module actually consists of two modules.  The
"CBM2MEM" module is mandatory and contains the RAM dump.  The "CBM2ROM"
module is optional and contains a dump of the ROM images.

The size of the CBM-II memory modules differs with each different memory
configuration.  The RAM configuration is saved in the snapshot, and
restored when the snapshot is loaded.

Version numbers: Major 1, Minor 0

The RAM* arrays are only saved if the RAM itself is less than 1M. If the
memory size is 1M then those areas are taken from the bank 15 area of
the normal RAM.

The memory array starts at $10000 if the memory size is less than 512k,
or at $00000 if 512k or more.  In case of a C510, then the memory array
also always starts at $00000.

11 Event history
****************

VICE supports recording an arbitrary session on the emulated machine and
playing back this session later.  This is done by saving a snapshot at
the beginning of the recording session and then remembering all the user
interaction such as keyboard and joystick input.  We call this an 'event
history'.  The main purpose for having an event history is to create
game sessions, e.g.  recording how to solve a game.  An example
walkthrough for the well known game "Fort Apocalypse" is available.

This brief chapter will advise you how to record and playback such a
session.  Although it is based on the WinVICE x64 release and its user
interface, histories may be transferred to other machines and other
ports that support event history, e.g.  the Unix port.

11.1 Recommended Settings
=========================

When using the event history feature it is possible that the playback
session differs from what was done at recording time.  This might arise
due to a problem in the initial snapshot or settings.  Here are some
suggestions to minimize the chance of failures in the session: a.  Reset
to default settings.  b.  Choose refresh rate 1/1.  c.  Choose joystick
and Video/Doublesize settings as desired or needed.  d.  SID engine must
be reSID (which is the default).  e.  Choose Drive settings/Idle method:
None Do not change any settings during recording or playback!

11.2 Recorded Events
====================

The following is a list of the user interaction that will be recorded: -
Joystick movement and button - Keyboard - Resetting the machine (hard
and soft) - Attaching or detaching disk/tape images (see 8.
Limitations) - Datasette controls

11.3 Recording an Event History
===============================

Recording an event history will create one or two files for a snapshot
and the list of the user events.  First, create an empty directory in
which these files are to be saved and then select this directory and the
name of the snapshot files via 'Snapshot//Select History
files/directory'.  Next, attach the disk or tape image with the game you
want to record and load and run the game.

Start recording via 'Snapshot//Start/Stop Recording History'.  Play the
game.  All actions will be recorded.  After the game is finished, stop
recording via 'Snapshot//Start/Stop Recording History'.  The selected
directory should now contain the two snapshot files (default ist
start.vsf and end.vsf).

11.4 Setting and Returning to Milestones
========================================

It is difficult to finish a game in one sitting and noone wants to
record all their mistakes and lost lives.  Use the milestone feature in
a recording session in the following way:

Set a milestone when you have finished a level or completed a task
('Snapshot//Set recording milestone' or ALT-E). This will save the event
history and a snapshot of the machine to the file end.vsf but recording
will continue.

Return to the last milestone when you have made a mistake or lost a life
('Snapshot//Return to milestone' or ALT-U). This will reset the game and
the event history to the last milestone snapshot so that you can try
again.

11.5 Continuing an Event History
================================

If you have stopped a recording session and want to continue it later,
you should create a backup of your start.vsf and end.vsf files first to
avoid overwriting them by accident.

Then change the event history start mode: 'Snapshot//Recording start
mode//Load existing snapshot'.  When you start recording now, you will
continue where the session was stopped last time.

Another way of continuing an existing history is to start somewhere
inside the history (e.g.  you have recorded 10 minutes of a game and
later recognize that you made a mistake after 6 minutes that makes it
impossible to finish the game).  For this you have to select the start
mode 'Overwrite playback'.  Now you can start the playback with
'Snapshot//Start/Stop Playback History' and when you reach the point
where you want to change the history you can directly switch to
recording via 'Snapshot//Start/Stop Recording History'.

11.6 Playing Back an Event History
==================================

To play back an event history, select the directory with the history
files start.vsf and end.vsf via 'Snapshot//Select History directory' and
start the playback with 'Snapshot//Start/Stop Playback History'.  Enjoy!
During playback any user interaction is disabled.  The playback stops
when the end of the session is reached or if 'Snapshot//Select History
directory' is selected again.

11.7 Limitations and Suggestions
================================

a.  Snapshot files will be quite big (>1MB) if a disk image has been
attached.  If possible, use PRG or T64 images to reduce the size of
snapshot files.  b.  Snapshots may not be 100% accurate even with all
the recommended settings.

11.8 Event history resources

12 Monitor
**********

Every VICE emulator has a complete built-in monitor, which can be used
to examine, disassemble and assemble machine language programs, as well
as debug them through breakpoints.  It can be activated by using the
"Activate monitor" command (left button menu).  Notice that in some
ports you have to run the emulator from a terminal emulation program
(such as 'rxvt' or 'xterm') in order to use the monitor.

12.1 Terminology
================

'address_space'
This refers to the range of memory locations and a set of
registers.  This can be the addresses available to the computer's
processor, the disk drive's processor or a specific memory
configuration of one of the mentioned processors.

'bankname'
The CPU can only see 64k of memory at any one time, due to its 16
bit address bus.  The C64 and other computers have more than this
amount, and this is handled by banking: a memory address can have
different contents, depending on the active memory bank.  A
bankname names a specific bank in the current address_space.

'register'
One of the following: program counter (PC), stack pointer (SP),
accumulator (A), X register (X), or Y register (Y).

'address'
A specific memory location in the range $0000 to $FFFF.

'address_range'
Two addresses.  If the second address is less than the first, the
range is assumed to wraparound from $FFFF to $0000.  Both addresses
must be in the same address space.

'address_opt_range'
An address or an address range.

'label'
'label' is the name of a label.  It must start with a dot (".")  in
order for the monitor to recognize it as a label.  Register names
preceeded by a dot (for example '.PC') are special labels that
evaluate to value of the respective register at the time it is
used, and thus can not be used as a regular label.

'prompt'
The prompt has the format [x:y].  If x is -, memory reads from the
monitor do not have side effects.  Otherwise, x is S. The second
part of the prompt, y, shows the default address space.

'checkpoint'
The monitor has the ability to setup triggers that perform an
action when a specified situation occurs.  There are three types of
checkpoints; breakpoints, tracepoints and watchpoints.

'breakpoint'
A breakpoint is triggered based on the program counter.  When it is
triggered, the monitor is entered.

'tracepoint'
Like breakpoints, a tracepoint is triggered based on the program
counter.  Instead of entering the monitor, the program counter is
printed and execution continues.

'watchpoint'
Watchpoints are triggered by a read and/or write to an address.
When a watchpoint is triggered, the monitor is entered.

'memmap'
The memmap keeps track of RAM/ROM/IO read/write/execute accesses.
The feature must be enabled with "-enable-cpuhistory" configure
option, as it might decrease performance notably on slower
hardware.  The option also enables CPU history.

'<...>'
A data type.

'*'
Zero or more occurrences.

'[...]'
An optional argument.

12.2 Machine state commands
===========================

'backtrace'
'bt'
Print JSR call chain (most recent call first).  Stack offset
relative to SP+1 is printed in parentheses.  This is a best guess
only.

'cpuhistory [<count>]'
'chis [<count>]'
Show <count> last executed commands.  (disabled by default;
configure with -enable-cpuhistory to enable)

'dump "<filename>"'
Write a snapshot of the machine into the file specified.  This
snapshot is compatible with a snapshot written out by the UI. Note:
No ROM images are included into the dump.

'goto <address>'
'g <address>'
Change the PC to address and continue execution.

'io [<address>]'
Display i/o registers.  Invoking without an address shows a dump of
the entire io range, if an address is given then details for the
chip at the respective (base-)address are displayed (if available).

'next [<count>]'
'n [<count>]'
Advance to the next instruction.  Subroutines are treated as a
single instruction.

'registers [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]'
'r [<reg_name> = <number> [, <reg_name> = <number>]*]'
Assign respective registers.  With no parameters, display register
values.

'reset [<type>]'
Reset the machine or drive.  'type': 0 = soft, 1 = hard, 8-11 =
drive.

'return'
'ret'
Continues execution and returns to the monitor just after the next
RTS or RTI is executed.

'step [<count>]'
'z [<count>]'
Single step through instructions.  An optional count allows
stepping more than a single instruction at a time.

'stopwatch [reset]'
Print the CPU cycle counter of the current device.  'reset' sets
the counter to 0.

'undump "<filename>"'
Read a snapshot of the machine from the file specified.

12.3 Memory commands
====================

'bank [<bankname>]'
Without a bankname, display all available banks for the current
address_space.  With a bankname given, switch to the specified
bank.  If a bank is not completely filled (ROM banks for example)
normally the 'ram' bank is used where the bank has holes.  The
'cpu' bank uses the bank currently used by the CPU.

'compare <address_range> <address>'
'c <address_range> <address>'
Compare memory from the source specified by the address range to
the destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.
Any values that miscompare are displayed using the default
displaytype.

'device [c:|8:|9:]'
Set the default address space to either the computer 'c:' or the
specified drive '8:' or '9:'

'fill <address_range> <data_list>'
'f <address_range> <data_list>'
Fill memory in the specified address range with the data in
<data_list>.  If the size of the address range is greater than the
size of the data_list, the data_list is repeated.

'hunt <address_range> <data_list>'
'h <address_range> <data_list>'
Hunt memory in the specified address range for the data in
<data_list>.  If the data is found, the starting address of the
match is displayed.  The entire range is searched for all possible
matches.  The data list may have 'xx' as a wildcard.

'i <address_opt_range>'
Display memory contents as PETSCII text.

'ii <address_opt_range>'
Display memory contents as screen code text

'mem [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
'm [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Display the contents of memory.  If no datatype is given, the
default is used.  If only one address is specified, the length of
data displayed is based on the datatype.  If no addresses are
given, the 'dot' address is used.

'memmapshow [<mask>] [<address_opt_range>]'
'mmsh [<mask>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Show the memmap.  The mask can be specified to show only those
locations with accesses of certain type(s).  The mask is a number
with the bits "ioRWXrwx", where RWX are for ROM and rwx for RAM.
Optionally, an address range can be specified.  (disabled by
default; configure with -enable-cpuhistory to enable)

'memmapzap'
'mmzap'
Clear the memmap.  (disabled by default; configure with
-enable-cpuhistory to enable)

'memmapsave "<filename>" <format>'
'mmsave "<filename>" <format>'
Save the memmap as a picture.  'format': 0 = BMP, 1 = PCX, 2 = PNG,
3 = GIF, 4 = IFF. (disabled by default; configure with
-enable-cpuhistory to enable)

'memchar [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
'mc [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Display the contents of memory as character data.  If only one
address is specified, only one character is displayed.  If no
addresses are given, the "dot" address is used.

'memsprite [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
'ms [<data_type>] [<address_opt_range>]'
Display the contents of memory as sprite data.  If only one address
is specified, only one sprite is displayed.  If no addresses are
given, the "dot" address is used.

'move <address_range> <address>'
't <address_range> <address>'
Move memory from the source specified by the address range to the
destination specified by the address.  The regions may overlap.

'screen'
'sc'
Displays the contents of the screen.

'sidefx [on|off|toggle]'
'sfx [on|off|toggle]'
Control how monitor generated reads affect memory locations that
have read side-effects, like CIA interrupt registers for example.
If the argument is 'on' then reads may cause side-effects.  If the
argument is 'off' then reads don't cause side-effects.  If the
argument is 'toggle' then the current mode is switched.  No
argument displays the current state.

'> [<address>] <data_list>'
Write the specified data at 'address'.

12.4 Assembly commands
======================

'a <address> [ <instruction> [: <instruction>]* ]'
Assemble instructions to the specified address.  If only one
instruction is specified, enter assembly mode (enter an empty line
to exit assembly mode).

'disass [<address> [<address>]]'
'd [<address> [<address>]]'
Disassemble instructions.  If two addresses are specified, they are
used as a start and end address.  If only one is specified, it is
treated as the start address and a default number of instructions
are disassembled.  If no addresses are specified, a default number
of instructions are disassembled from the dot address.

12.5 Checkpoint commands
========================

'break [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
This command allows setting a breakpoint or listing the current
breakpoints.  If no address is given, the currently valid
checkpoints are printed.  If an address is given, a breakpoint is
set for that address and the breakpoint number is printed.  The
"load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or "exec"
(or any combination of these) to determine on which operation the
monitor breaks.  If not specified, the monitor breaks on "exec".  A
conditional expression can also be specified for the breakpoint.
For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

'enable <checknum>'
'disable <checknum>'
Each checkpoint can be enabled or disabled.  This command allows
changing between these states.

'command <checknum> "<command>"'
When checkpoint 'checknum' is hit, the specified command is
executed by the monitor.  Note that the 'x' command is not yet
supported as a command argument.

'condition <checknum> if <cond_expr>'
'cond <checknum> if <cond_expr>'
Each time the specified checkpoint is examined, the condition is
evaluated.  If it evalutes to true, the checkpoint is activated.
Otherwise, it is ignored.  If registers are specified in the
expression, the values used are those at the time the checkpoint is
examined, not when the condition is set.

Currently, the cond_expr is very limited.  You can use registers
(.A, .X, .Y, .PC, and .SP) and compare against other registers or
absolute values.  For example, the following are all valid
conditions: .A == 0, .X == .Y, 8:.X == .X, .A != 5, .A < .X.

However, you cannot specify memory contents and compare that.

'delete <checknum>'
'del <checknum>'
Delete the specified checkpoint.

'ignore <checknum> [<count>]'
Ignore a checkpoint after a given number of crossings.  If no count
is given, the default value is 1.

'trace [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
'tr [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
This command is similar to the 'break' command except that it
operates on tracepoints.  A tracepoint differs from a breakpoint by
not stopping execution but simply printing the PC, giving the user
an execution trace.  The second optional address can be used to
specify the end of an range of addresses to be traced.  If no
addresses are given, a list of all the checkpoints is printed.  The
"load|store|exec" parameter can be either "load", "store" or "exec"
(or any combination of these) to determine which operation the
monitor traces.  If not specified, the monitor traces all
operations.  A conditional expression can also be specified for the
tracepoint.  For more information on conditions, see the CONDITION
command.

'until [<address>]'
'un [<address>]'
If no address is given, the currently valid breakpoints are
printed.  If an address is given, a temporary breakpoint is set for
that address and the breakpoint number is printed.  Control is
returned to the emulator by this command.  The breakpoint is
deleted once it is hit.

'watch [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
'w [load|store|exec] [address [address] [if <cond_expr>]]'
This command is similar to the 'break' command except that it
operates on watchpoints.  A watchpoint differs from a breakpoint by
stopping on a read and/or write to an address or range of
addresses.  If no addresses are given, a list of all the
checkpoints is printed.  The "load|store|exec" parameter can be
either "load", "store" or "exec" (or any combination of these) to
determine on which operation the monitor breaks.  If not specified,
the monitor breaks on "load" and "store" operations.  A conditional
expression can also be specified for the watchpoint.  For more
information on conditions, see the CONDITION command.

12.6 General commands
=====================

'cd <directory>'
Change the working directory.

'device [c:|8:|9:]'
'dev [c:|8:|9:]'
Set the default address space to either the computer ('c:') or the
disk ('8:|9:').

'dir [<directory>]'
'ls [<directory>]'
Display the directory contents.

'pwd'
Show current working directory.

'radix [H|D|O|B]'
'rad [H|D|O|B]'
Set the default radix to hex, decimal, octal, or binary.  With no
argument, the current radix is printed.

12.7 Disk commands
==================

'attach <filename> <device>'
Attach file to device.  (device 32 = cart)

'block_read <track> <sector> [<address>]'
'br <track> <sector> [<address>]'
Read the block at the specified track and sector.  If an address is
specified, the data is loaded into memory.  If no address is given,
the data is displayed using the default datatype.

'block_write <track> <sector> <address>'
'bw <track> <sector> <address>'
Write a block of data at 'address' to the specified track and
sector of disk in drive 8.

'detach <device>'
Detach file from device.  (device 32 = cart)

'@<disk command>'
Perform a disk command on the currently attached disk image on
drive 8.  The specified disk command is sent to the drive's channel
#15.

'load "<filename>" <device> [<address>]'
'l "<filename>" <device> [<address>]'
Load the specified file into memory.  If no address is given, the
file is loaded to the address specified by the first two bytes read
from the file.  If address is given, the file is loaded to the
specified address and the first two bytes read from the file are
skipped.  If device is 0, the file is read from the file system.

'list [<directory>]'
List disk contents.

'bload "<filename>" <device> <address>'
'bl "<filename>" <device> <address>'
Load the specified file into memory at the specified address.  If
device is 0, the file is read from the file system.

'save "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
's "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
Save the memory from address1 to address2 to the specified file.
Write two-byte load address.  If device is 0, the file is written
to the file system.

'bsave "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
'bs "<filename>" <device> <address1> <address2>'
Save the memory from address1 to address2 to the specified file.
If device is 0, the file is written to the file system.

12.8 Command file commands
==========================

'playback "<filename>"'
'pb "<filename>"'
Monitor commands from the specified file are read and executed.
This command stops at the end of file or when a STOP command is
read.

'record "<filename>"'
'rec "<filename>"'
After this command, all commands entered are written to the
specified file until the STOP command is entered.

'stop'
Stop recording commands.  See 'record'.

12.9 Label commands
===================

'add_label <address> <label>'
'al <address> <label>'
Map a given address to a label.  This label can be used when
entering assembly code and is shown during disassembly.
Additionally, it can be used whenever an address must be specified.

<label> is the name of the label; it must start with a dot (".")
in order for the monitor to recognize it as a label.

'delete_label [<address_space>] <label>'
'dl [<address_space>] <label>'
Remove the specified label from the label tables.  If no address
space is checked, all tables are checked.

'load_labels [<address_space>] "<filename>"'
'll [<address_space>] "<filename>"'
Load a file containing a mapping of labels to addresses.  If no
address space is specified, the default readspace is used.

The file must contain commands the monitor understands, e.g.
add_label.  The compiler cc65 can create such label files.

Vice can also load label files created by the Acme assembler.
Their syntax is e.g.  "labelname = $1234 ; Maybe a comment".  A dot
will be added automatically to label names assigned in this way to
fit to the Vice label syntax.  Normally the semicolon seperates
commands but after an assignment of this kind it may be used to
start a comment to end of line, so unchanged Acme label files can
be fed into Vice.

'save_labels [<address_space>] "<filename>"'
'sl [<address_space>] "<filename>"'
Save labels to a file.  If no address space is specified, all of
the labels are saved.

'show_labels [<address_space>]'
'shl [<address_space>]'
Display current label mappings.  If no address space is specified,
show all labels from default address space.

'clear_labels [<address_space>]'
'cl [<address_space>]'
Clear current label mappings.  If no address space is specified,
clear all labels from default address space.

13 c1541
********

VICE is provided with a complete stand-alone disk image maintenance
utility, called 'c1541'.

You can either invoke it from the command line or from within one of the
VICE emulators, using the "Run c1541" menu item which will open a new
terminal window with a running 'c1541' in it.

The syntax is:

c1541 [IMAGE1 [IMAGE2]] [COMMAND1 COMMAND2 ... COMMANDN]

'IMAGE1' and 'IMAGE2' are disk image names that can be attached before
'c1541' starts.  'c1541' can handle up to two disk images at the same
time by using two virtual built-in drives, numbered '8' and '9';
'IMAGE1' (if present) is always attached to drive '8', while 'IMAGE2' is
attached to drive '9'.

'COMMAND's specified on the command-line all begin with the minus sign
('-'); if present, 'c1541' executes them in the same order as they are
on the command line and returns a zero error code if they were
successful.  If any of the 'COMMAND's fails, 'c1541' stops and returns a
nonzero error code.

If no 'COMMAND's are specified at all, 'c1541' enters interactive mode,
where you can type commands manually.  Commands in interactive mode are
the same as commands in batch mode, but do not require a leading '-'.
As with the monitor, file name completion and command line editing with
history are provided via GNU 'readline'.  Use the command 'quit' or
press 'C-d' to exit.

13.1 Specifying files in c1541
==============================

When accessing CBM DOS files (i.e.  files that reside on disk images),
c1541 uses a special syntax that lets you access files on both drive 8
and 9.  If you prepend the file name with '@8:' or '@9:', you will
specified that file is to be found or created on drive 8 and 9,
respectively.

For instance,

@8:somefile

will name file named 'somefile' on unit 8, while

@9:somefile

will name file named 'somefile' on unit 9.

13.2 Using quotes and backslashes
=================================

You can use quotes ('"') in a command to embed spaces into file names.
For instance,

read some file

will read file 'some' from the disk image and write it into the file
system as 'file', while

read "some file"

will copy 'some file' into the file system, with the name 'some file'.

The backslash character ('') has a special meaning too: it lets you
literally insert the following character no matter what it is.  For
example,

read some file

will copy file 'some file' into the file system, while

read some file this"file

will copy 'some file' into the file system with name 'this"file' (with
an embedded quote).

13.3 c1541 commands and options
===============================

This is a list of the 'c1541' commands.  They are shown in their
interactive form, without the leading '-'.  Square brackets [] indicate
an optional part, and "<COMMAND>" translates to a disk command according

16 The emulator file formats
****************************

This chapter gives a technical description of the various files
supported by the emulators.

16.1 The T64 tape image format
==============================

(This section was taken from the C64S distribution.)

The 'T64' File Structure was developed by Miha Peternel for use in the
C64S emulator.  It is easy to use and allows future extensions.

16.1.1 T64 File structure
-------------------------

64                     32*n                   file records for n
directory entries
64+32*n                varies                 binary contents of the
files

16.1.2 Tape Record

2                      2                      start address
4                      2                      end address
6                      2                      free
8                      4                      offset of file contents
start within T64 file
12                     4                      free
16                     16                     C64 file name

Valid entry types are:

Code                   Explanation
'0'                    free entry
'1'                    normal tape file
'2'                    tape file with header: header is saved just
before file data
'3'                    memory snapshot v0.9, uncompressed
'4'                    tape block
'5'                    digitized stream
'6' ... '255'          reserved

Notes:

* VICE only supports file type '1'.
* Types '3', '4' and '5' are subject to change (and are rarely used).

16.2 The G64 GCR-encoded disk image format
==========================================

16.2.1 The original format
--------------------------

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Ettore Perazzoli.)

This format was defined in 1998 as a cooperative effort between several
emulator people, mainly Per Hkan Sundell, author of the CCS64 C64
emulator, Andreas Boose of the VICE CBM emulator team and Joe
Forster/STA, the author of Star Commander.  It was the first real public
attempt to create a format for the emulator community which removed
almost all of the drawbacks of the other existing image formats, namely
'D64'.

The intention behind 'G64' is not to replace the widely used 'D64'
format, as 'D64' works fine with the vast majority of disks in
existence.  It is intended for those small percentage of programs which
demand to work with the 1541 drive in a non-standard way, such as
reading or writing data in a custom format.  The best example is with
speeder software such as Action Cartridge in Warp Save mode or Vorpal
which write track/sector data in another format other than standard GCR.
The other obvious example is copy-protected software which looks for
some specific data on a track, like the disk ID, which is not stored in
a standard 'D64' image.

'G64' has a deceptively simply layout for what it is capable of doing.
We have a signature, version byte, some predefined size values, and a
series of offsets to the track data and speed zones.  It is what's
contained in the track data areas and speed zones which is really at the
heart of this format.

Each track entry in simply the raw stream of GCR data, just what a read
head would see when a diskette is rotating past it.  How the data gets
interpreted is up to the program trying to access the disk.  Because the
data is stored in such a low-level manner, just about anything can be
done.  Most of the time I would suspect the data in the track would be
standard sectors, with SYNC, GAP, header, data and checksums.  The
arrangement of the data when it is in a standard GCR sector layout is
beyond the scope of this document.

Since it is a flexible format in both track count and track byte size,
there is no "standard" file size.  However, given a few constants like
42 tracks and halftracks, a track size of 7928 bytes and no speed offset
entries, the typical file size will a minimum of 333744 bytes.

Below is a dump of the header, broken down into its various parts.
After that will be an explanation of the track offset and speed zone
offset areas, as they demand much more explanation.

Addr  00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
----  -----------------------------------------------
0000: 47 43 52 2D 31 35 34 31 00 54 F8 1E .. .. .. ..

Offset         Description
$0000-0007     File signature ('GCR-1541')
$0008          'G64' version (presently only $00 defined)
$0009          Number of tracks in image (usually $54, decimal 84)
$000A-000B     Size of each stored track in bytes (usually 7928, or
$1EF8) in LO/HI format.

An obvious question here is "why are there 84 tracks defined when a
normal 'D64' disk only has 35 tracks?"  Well, by definition, this image
includes all half-tracks, so there are actually 42 tracks and 42 half
tracks.  The 1541 stepper motor can access up to 42 tracks and the
in-between half-tracks.  Even though using more than 35 tracks is not
typical, it was important to define this format from the start with what
the 1541 is capable of doing, and not just what it typically does.

At first, the defined track size value of 7928 bytes may seem to be
arbitrary, but it is not.  It is determined by the fastest write speed
possible (speed zone 0), coupled with the average rotation speed of the
disk (300 rpm).  After some math, the answer that actually comes up is
7692 bytes.  Why the discrepency between the actual size of 7692 and the
defined size of 7928?  Simply put, not all drives rotate at 300 rpm.
Some can be faster or slower, so a upper safety margin of +3% was built
added, in case some disks rotate slower and can write more data.  After
applying this safety factor, and some rounding-up, 7928 bytes per track
was arrived at.

Also note that this upper limit of 7928 bytes per track really only
applies to 1541 and compatible disks.  If this format were applied to
another disk type like the SFD1001, this value would be higher.

Below is a dump of the first section of a 'G64' file, showing the
offsets to the data portion for each track and half-track entry.
Following that is a dump of the speed zone offsets.

$015C-015F     Speed zone entry for track 1 ($03, in LO/HI format, see
below for more)
$0160-0163     Speed zone entry for track 1.5 ($03)
...
$02A4-02A7     Speed zone entry for track 42 ($00)
$02A8-02AB     Speed zone entry for track 42.5 ($00)

Starting here at $02AC is the first track entry (from above, it is the
first entry for track 1.0)

The track offsets (from above) require some explanation.  When one is
set to all 0's, no track data exists for this entry.  If there is a
value, it is an absolute reference into the file (starting from the
beginning of the file).  From the track 1.0 entry we see it is set for
$000002AC. Going to that file offset, here is what we see...

$02AC-02AD     Actual size of stored track (7692 or $1E0C, in LO/HI
format)
$02AE-02AE+$1E0CTrack data

Following the track data is filler bytes.  In this case, there are 368
bytes of unused space.  This space can contain anything, but for the
sake of those wishing to compress these images for storage, they should
all be set to the same value.  In the sample I used, these are all set
to $FF.

Below is a dump of the end of the track 1.0 data area.  Note the actual
track data ends at address $20B9, with the rest of the block being
unused, and set to $FF.

The speed offset entries can be a little more complex.  The 1541 has
four speed zones defined, which means the drive can write data at four
distinct speeds.  On a normal 1541 disk, these zones are as follows:

Track Range                          Speed Zone
1-17                                 3 (highest writing speed)
18-24                                2
25-30                                1
31 and up                            0 (lowest writing speed)

Note that you can, through custom programming of the 1541, change the
speed zone of any track to something different (change the 3 to a 0) and
write data differently.  From the dump of the speed offset entries
above, we see that all the entries are in the range of 0-3.  If any
entry is less than 4, this is not considered a speed offset but defines
the whole track to be recorded at that one speed.

In the example I had, there were no offsets defined, so no speed zone
dump can be shown.  However, I can define what should be there.  You
will have a block of data, 1982 bytes long.  Each byte is encoded to
represent the speed of 4 bytes in the track offset area, and is broken
down as follows:

Speed entry $FF:  in binary %11111111
|'|'|'|'
| | | |
| | | +- 4'th byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
| | +--- 3'rd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
| +----- 2'nd byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)
+------- 1'st byte speed (binary 11, 3 dec)

It was very smart thinking to allow for two speed zone settings, one in
the offset block and another defining the speed on a per-byte basis.  If
you are working with a normal disk, where each track is one constant
speed, then you don't need the extra blocks of information hanging
around the image, wasting space.

What may not be obvious is the flexibility of this format to add tracks
and speed offset zones at will.  If a program decides to write a track
out with varying speeds, and no speed offset exist, a new block will be
created by appending it to the end of the image, and the offset pointer
for that track set to point to the new block.  If a track has no offset
yet, meaning it doesn't exist (like a half-track), and one needs to be
added, the same procedure applies.  The location of the actual track or
speed zone data is not important, meaning they do not have to be in any
particular order since they are all referenced by the offsets at the
beginning of the image.

16.2.2 An extension for double sided disks (Commodore VIC 1571)
---------------------------------------------------------------

Given that a Commodore VIC 1541/1570/1571 can read/write at most 42
tracks per side, it is quite natural to use the half-tracks from 1 to 84
for the first side and the following 84 half-tracks (i.  e.  halg.track
85 to 168) for the second size.

In order for this to work, byte 9 of the image (i.  e.  the maximum
number of tracks) usually contains 168 for double sided disks.

To make identifying such images easy, the fiel signature in the first 8
bytes of such files will be 'GCR-1571').

All initial model state values are initialized with zero.

All initial model probability values are initialized with 2048.

These model probability values will be updating in a adaptive way on the
fly and not precalculated before the encoding and even not loaded before
the decoding, see pseudo code below.

16000000 Hz / 5 rotations per second at 300 RPM = maximal 3200000 flux
pulses

So NRZI transition flux pulse positions are in the 0 ..  3199999 value
range, which is also a exact single rotation, where each time unit is a
cycle at 16 MHz with 300 RPM as a mapping for the ideal case.

The NRZI transition flux pulse stength are in the 0x00000000 ..
0xffffffff value range, where 0xffffffff indices a strong flux pulse,
that always triggers, and 0x00000001 indices a weak flux pulse, that
almost never triggers, and 0x00000000 indices a flux pulse, that
absolutly never triggers.

For 32-bit values, the model sub streams are subdivided byte wide in a
little-endian manner, and each byte is processed bitwise with model
probability shifting of 4 bits, just as:

Pascal-Style pseudo code:
procedure WriteDWord(Model, Value : longword);
var ByteValue, ByteIndex, Context, Bit : longword;
begin
for ByteIndex := 0 to 3 do begin
ByteValue := (Value shr (ByteIndex shl 3)) and $ff;
Context := 1;
for Bit := 7 downto 0 do begin
Context := (Context shl 1) or RangeCoderEncodeBit(
RangeCoderProbabilities[
RangeCoderProbabilityOffsets[Model + ByteIndex] +
(((RangeCoderProbabilityStates[Model + ByteIndex]
shl 8) or Context) and $ffff)], 4, (ByteValue shr
Bit) and 1);
end;
RangeCoderProbabilityStates[Model+ByteIndex] := ByteValue;
end;
end;

And for 1-bit flag values it is much simpler, but also with model
probability shifting of 4 bits, just as:

Pascal-Style pseudo code:
procedure WriteBit(Model, Value : longword);
begin
RangeCoderProbabilityStates[Model] :=
RangeCoderEncodeBit(RangeCoderProbabilities[
RangeCoderProbabilityOffsets[Model] +
RangeCoderProbabilityStates[Model]], 4, Value and 1);
end;

The position and strength values are delta-encoded.  If a value is equal
to the last previous value, then the value will not encoded, instead, a
flag for this will encoded.  First the position value will encoded, then
the stength value.  If the last position delta is 0, then it is a track
stream end marker.

Pascal-Style pseudo code:
LastPosition := 0;
PreviousDeltaPosition := 0

LastStrength := 0;

for PulseIndex := 0 to PulseCount - 1 do begin

DeltaPosition := Pulses[PulseIndex].Position - LastPosition;
if PreviousDeltaPosition <> DeltaPosition then begin
PreviousDeltaPosition := DeltaPosition;
WriteBit(ModelPositionFlag, 1)
WriteDWord(ModelPosition, DeltaPosition);
end else begin
WriteBit(ModelPositionFlag, 0);
end;
LastPosition := Pulses[PulseIndex].Position;

if LastStrength <> Pulses[PulseIndex].Strength then begin
WriteBit(ModelStrengthFlag, 1)
WriteDWord(ModelStrength, Pulses[PulseIndex].Strength - LastStrength);
end else begin
WriteBit(ModelStrengthFlag, 0);
end;
LastStrength := Pulses^[PulseIndex].Strength;

end;

// End code
WriteBit(ModelPositionFlag, 1);
WriteDWord(ModelPosition, 0);

The decoding is simply just in the another direction way.

Pseudo code for a FPAQ0-style carryless range coder:

Pascal-Style pseudo code:
procedure RangeCoderInit; // At encoding and decoding start
begin
RangeCode := 0;
RangeLow := 0;
RangeHigh := $ffffffff;
end;

procedure RangeCoderStart; // At decoding start
var Counter : longword;
begin
for Counter := 1 to 4 do begin
RangeCode := (RangeCode shl 8) or ReadByteFromInput;
end;
end;

procedure RangeCoderFlush; // At encoding end
var Counter : longword;
begin
for Counter := 1 to 4 do begin
WriteByteToOutput(RangeHigh shr 24);
RangeHigh := RangeHigh shl 8;
end;
end;

procedure RangeCoderEncodeNormalize;
begin
while ((RangeLow xor RangeHigh) and $ff000000) = 0 do begin
WriteByteToOutput(RangeHigh shr 24);
RangeLow := RangeLow shl 8;
RangeHigh := (RangeHigh shl 8) or $ff;
end;
end;

function RangeCoderEncodeBit(var Probability : longword; Shift,
BitValue : longword) : longword;
begin
RangeMiddle := RangeLow + (((RangeHigh - RangeLow) shr 12) *
Probability);
if BitValue <> 0 then begin
inc(Probability, ($fff - Probability) shr Shift);
RangeHigh := RangeMiddle;
end else begin
dec(Probability, Probability shr Shift);
RangeLow := RangeMiddle + 1;
end;
RangeCoderEncodeNormalize;
result := BitValue;
end;

procedure RangeCoderDecodeNormalize;
begin
while ((RangeLow xor RangeHigh) and $ff000000) = 0 do begin
RangeLow := RangeLow shl 8;
RangeHigh := (RangeHigh shl 8) or $ff;
RangeCode := (RangeCode shl 8) or ReadByteFromInput;
end;
end;

function RangeCoderDecodeBit(var Probability : longword;
Shift : longword) : longword;
begin
RangeMiddle := RangeLow + (((RangeHigh - RangeLow) shr 12) *
Probability);
if RangeCode <= RangeMiddle then begin
inc(Probability, ($fff - Probability) shr Shift);
RangeHigh := RangeMiddle;
result := 1;
end else begin
dec(Probability, Probability shr Shift);
RangeLow := RangeMiddle + 1;
result := 0;
end;
RangeCoderDecodeNormalize;
end;

The probability may be never zero!  But that can't happen here with this
adaptive model in this P64 file format, since the adaptive model uses a
shift factor of 4 bits and initial probabilities value of 2048, so the
probability has a value range from 15 up to 4080 here.  If you do want
to use the above range coder routines for other stuff with other
probability models, then you must to ensure that the probability output
value is never zero, for example with "probability |= (probability < 1);
" in C.

This is the last empty chunk for to signalize that the correct file end
is reached.

16.4 The D64 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.  Added 42 track info by groepaz)

First and foremost we have D64, which is basically a sector-for-sector
copy of a 1540/1541 disk.  There are several versions of these which I
will cover shortly.  The standard D64 is a 174848 byte file comprised of
256 byte sectors arranged in 35 tracks with a varying number of sectors
per track for a total of 683 sectors.  Track counting starts at 1, not
0, and goes up to 35.  Sector counting starts at 0, not 1, for the first
sector, therefore a track with 21 sectors will go from 0 to 20.

The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in circles,
with track 1 on the very outside of the disk (closest to the sides) to
track 35 being on the inside of the disk (closest to the inner hub
ring).  Commodore, in their infinite wisdom, varied the number of
sectors per track and data densities across the disk to optimize
available storage, resulting in the chart below.  It shows the
sectors/track for a standard D64.  Since the outside diameter of a
circle is the largest (versus closer to the center), the outside tracks
have the largest amount of storage.

Track                    Sectors/track            # Sectors

The directory track should be contained totally on track 18.  Sectors
1-18 contain the entries and sector 0 contains the BAM (Block
Availability Map) and disk name/ID. Since the directory is only 18
sectors large (19 less one for the BAM), and each sector can contain
only 8 entries (32 bytes per entry), the maximum number of directory
entries is 18 * 8 = 144.  The first directory sector is always 18/1,
even though the t/s pointer at 18/0 (first two bytes) might point
somewhere else.  It then follows the same chain structure as a normal
file, using a sector interleave of 3.  This makes the chain links go
18/1, 18/4, 18/7 etc.

Note that you can extend the directory off of track 18, but only when
reading the disk or image.  Attempting to write to a directory sector
not on track 18 will cause directory corruption.  Each directory sector
has the following layout (18/1 partial dump):

00: 12 04 81 11 00 4E 41 4D 45 53 20 26 20 50 4F 53 <- notice the T/S link
10: 49 54 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 15 00 <- to 18/4 ($12/$04)
20: 00 00 84 11 02 41 44 44 49 54 49 4F 4E 41 4C 20 <- and how its not here
30: 49 4E 46 4F A0 11 0C FE 00 00 00 00 00 00 61 01 <- ($00/$00)

The first two bytes of the sector ($12/$04) indicate the location of the
next track/sector of the directory (18/4).  If the track is set to $00,
then it is the last sector of the directory.  It is possible, however
unlikely, that the directory may *not* be competely on track 18 (some
disks do exist like this).  Just follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00.  The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter.  The drive will return
all the available entries anyways.

This is a breakdown of a standard directory sector:

Bytes          Description
$00-$1F        First directory entry
$20-$3F        Second dir entry
$40-$5F        Third dir entry
$60-$7F        Fourth dir entry
$80-$9F        Fifth dir entry
$A0-$BF        Sixth dir entry
$C0-$DF        Seventh dir entry
$E0-$FF        Eighth dir entry

This is a breakdown of a standard directory entry:

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00 $00
if not the first entry in the sector)
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file
$05-$14        16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first side-sector block (REL
file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only, max.  value 254)
$18-$1D        Unused (except with GEOS disks)
$1E-$1F        File size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E+$1F*256).
The approx.  filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE-@ replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ
0010           2              PRG
0011           3              USR
0100           4              REL

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange results.
The 1541 is inconsistent in how it treats these bits.  Some routines use
all 4 bits, others ignore bit 3, resulting in values from 0-7.

Files, on a standard 1541, are stored using an interleave of 10.
Assuming a starting track/sector of 17/0, the chain would run 17/0,
17/10, 17/20, 17/8, 17/18, etc.

16.4.1 Non-Standard & Long Directories
--------------------------------------

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory track
where all filenames are stored.  This limits the number of files stored
on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.  There
are some disk images that contain more files than would normally be
allowed.  This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there.  The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive.  However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part.  Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is on
and assume the default directory track for operations.

To explain: assume that the directory has been extended from track 18 to
track 19/6 and that the directory is full except for a few slots on
19/6.  When saving a new file, the drive DOS will find an empty file
slot at 19/6 offset $40 and correctly write the filename and a few other
things into this slot.  When the file is done being saved the final file
information will be written to 18/6 offset $40 instead of 19/6 causing
some directory corruption to the entry at 18/6.  Also, the BAM entries
for the sectors occupied by the new file will not be saved and the new
file will be left as a SPLAT (*) file.

Attempts to validate the disk will result in those files residing off
the directory track to not be allocated in the BAM, and could also send
the drive into an endless loop.  The default directory track is assumed
for all sector reads when validating so if the directory goes to 19/6,
then the validate code will read 18/6 instead.  If 18/6 is part of the
normal directory chain then the validate routine will loop endlessly.

16.4.2 BAM layout
-----------------

The layout of the BAM area (sector 18/0) is a bit more complicated...

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of the first directory sector
(should be set to 18/1 but it doesn't matter, and don't
trust what is there, always go to 18/1 for first
directory entry)
$02            Disk DOS version type (see note below) $41 ("A")
$03            Unused
$04-$8F        BAM entries for each track, in groups of four bytes per
track, starting on track 1 (see below for more details)
$90-$9F        Disk Name (padded with $A0)
$A0-$A1        Filled with $A0
$A2-$A3        Disk ID
$A4            Usually $A0
$A5-$A6        DOS type, usually "2A"
$A7-$AA        Filled with $A0
$AB            Unused ($00)
$AC-$BF        For DOLPHIN DOS track 36-40 BAM entries, otherwise
unused ($00)
$C0-$D3        For SPEED DOS track 36-40 BAM entries, otherwise unused
($00)
$D4-$FF
Unused ($00)

Note: The BAM entries for SPEED, DOLPHIN and ProLogic DOS use the same
layout as standard BAM entries.  One of the interesting things from the
BAM sector is the byte at offset $02, the DOS version byte.  If it is
set to anything other than $41 or $00, then we have what is called "soft
write protection".  Any attempt to write to the disk will return the
"DOS Version" error code 73 ,"CBM DOS V 2.6 1541".  The 1541 is simply
telling you that it thinks the disk format version is incorrect.  This
message will normally come up when you first turn on the 1541 and read
the error channel.  If you write a $00 or a $41 into 1541 memory
location $00FF (for device 0), then you can circumvent this type of
write-protection, and change the DOS version back to what it should be.

The BAM entries require a bit (no pun intended) more of a breakdown.
Take the first entry at bytes $04-$07 ($12 $FF $F9 $17).  The first byte
($12) is the number of free sectors on that track.  Since we are looking
at the track 1 entry, this means it has 18 (decimal) free sectors.  The
next three bytes represent the bitmap of which sectors are used/free.
Since it is 3 bytes (8 bits/byte) we have 24 bits of storage.  Remember
that at most, each track only has 21 sectors, so there are a few unused
bits.

Bytes          Data                          Description
$04-$07        $12 $FF $F9 $17               Track 1 BAM
$08-$0B        $15 $FF $FF $FF               Track 2 BAM
$0C-$0F        $15 $FF $FF $1F               Track 3 BAM
...            ...                           ...
$8C-$8F        $11 $FF $FF $01               Track 35 BAM

These entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense.  We will use
the first entry (track 1) at bytes 04-07:

FF=11111111, F9=11111001, 17=00010111

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222
01234567 89012345 67890123
--------------------------
11111111 10011111 11101000
^                     ^
sector 0           sector 20

Since we are on the first track, we have 21 sectors, and only use up to
the bit 20 position.  If a bit is on (1), the sector is free.
Therefore, track 1 has sectors 9, 10 and 19 used, all the rest are free.
Any leftover bits that refer to sectors that don't exist, like bits
21-23 in the above example, are set to allocated.

Each filetype has its own unique properties, but most follow one simple
structure.  The first file sector is pointed to by the directory and
follows a t/s chain, until the track value reaches $00.  When this
happens, the value in the sector link location indicates how much of the
sector is used.  For example, the following chain indicates a file 6
sectors long, and ends when we encounter the $00/$34 chain.  At this
point the last sector occupies from bytes $02-$34.

1            2            3            4            5            6
---          ---          ---          ---          ---          ---
17/0         17/10        17/20        17/1         17/11        0/52
(11/00)      (11/0A)      (11/14)      (11/01)      (11/0B)      (0/34)

16.4.3 Variations on the D64 layout
-----------------------------------

These are some variations of the D64 layout:

1.  Standard 35 track layout but with 683 error bytes added on to the
end of the file.  Each byte of the error info corresponds to a single
sector stored in the D64, indicating if the sector on the original disk
contained an error.  The first byte is for track 1/0, and the last byte
is for track 35/16.

2.  A 40 track layout, following the same layout as a 35 track disk, but
with 5 extra tracks.  These contain 17 sectors each, like tracks 31-35.
Some of the PC utilities do allow you to create and work with these
files.  This can also have error bytes attached like variant #1.

3.  A 42 track layout, with two extra tracks of 17 sectors each.  This
is extremely uncommon, since real drives often have problems with
accessing these tracks, software that uses them is very rare.

4.  The Commodore 128 allowed for "auto-boot" disks.  With this, t/s 1/0
holds a specific byte sequence which the computer recognizes as boot
code.

Below is a small chart detailing the standard file sizes of D64 images,
35, 40 or 42 tracks, with or without error bytes.

Disk type                            Size
35 track, no errors                  174848
35 track, 683 error bytes            175531
40 track, no errors                  196608
40 track, 768 error bytes            197376
42 track, no errors                  205312
42 track, 802 error bytes            206114

The following table (provided by Wolfgang Moser) outlines the
differences between the standard 1541 DOS and the various "speeder"
DOS's that exist.  The 'header 7/8' category is the 'fill bytes' as the
end of the sector header of a real 1541 disk.

*Note: There are also clones of SpeedDOS that exist, such as RoloDOS and
DigiDOS. Both are just a change of the DOS startup string.

The location of the extra BAM information in sector 18/0, for 40 track
images, will be different depending on what standard the disks have been
formatted with.  SPEED DOS stores them from $C0 to $D3, DOLPHIN DOS
stores them from $AC to $BF and PrologicDOS stored them right after the
existing BAM entries from $90-A3.  PrologicDOS also moves the disk label
and ID forward from the standard location of $90 to $A4.  64COPY and
Star Commander let you select from several different types of extended
disk formats you want to create/work with.

All three of the speeder DOS's mentioned above don't alter the standard
sector interleave of 10 for files and 3 for directories.  The reason is
that they use a memory cache installed in the drive which reads the
entire track in one pass.  This alleviates the need for custom
interleave values.  They do seem to alter the algorithm that finds the
next available free sector so that the interleave value can deviate from
10 under certain circumstances, but I don't know why they would bother.

16.4.4 Error codes
------------------

Here is the meaning of the error bytes added onto the end of any
extended D64.  The CODE is the same as that generated by the 1541 drive
controller... it reports these numbers, not the error code we usually
see when an error occurs.

Some of what comes below is taken from Immers/Neufeld book "Inside
Commodore DOS". Note the descriptions are not completely accurate as to
what the drive DOS is actually doing to seek/read/decode/write sectors,
but serve as simple examples only.  The "type" field is where the error
usually occurs, whether it's searching for any SYNC mark, any header ID,
any valid header, or reading a sector.

Code           Error          Type           D64            Description

Codes $0 and $C to $E are unused and never occur.

These first errors are "seek" errors, where the disk controller is
simply reading headers and looking at descriptor bytes, checksums,
format ID's and reporting what errors it sees.  These errors do *not*
necessarily apply to the exact sector being looked for.  This fact makes
duplication of these errors very unreliable.

Code : $03 Error : 21 Type : Seek Message : No SYNC sequence found.

Each sector data block and header block are preceeded by SYNC marks.  If
*no* sync sequence is found within 20 milliseconds (only ~1/10 of a disk
rotation!)  then this error is generated.  This error used to mean the
entire track is bad, but it does not have to be the case.  Only a small
area of the track needs to be without a SYNC mark and this error will be
generated.

Converting this error to a D64 is very problematic because it depends on
where the physical head is on the disk when a read attempt is made.  If
it is on valid header/sectors then it won't occur.  If it happens over
an area without SYNC marks, it will happen.

Code : $02 Error : 20 Type : Seek Message : Header descriptor byte not
found (HEX $08, GCR $52)

Each sector is preceeded by an 8-byte GCR header block, which starts
with the value $52 (GCR). If this value is not found after 90 attempts,
this error is generated.

Basically, what a track has is SYNC marks, and possibly valid data
blocks, but no valid header descriptors.

Code : $09 Error : 27 Type : Seek Message : Checksum error in header
block

The header block contains a checksum value, calculated by XOR'ing the
TRACK, SECTOR, ID1 and ID2 values.  If this checksum is wrong, this
error is generated.

Code : $0B Error : 29 Type : Seek Message : Disk sector ID mismatch

The ID's from the header block of the currently read sector are compared
against the ones from the low-level header of 18/0.  If there is a
mismatch, this error is generated.

Code : $02 Error : 20 Type : Seek Message : Header block not found

This error can be reported again when searching for the correct header
block.  An image of the header is built and searched for, but not found
after 90 read attempts.  Note the difference from the first occurance.
The first one only searches for a valid ID, not the whole header.

Note that error 20 occurs twice during this phase.  The first time is
when a header ID is being searched for, the second is when the proper
header pattern for the sector being searched for is not found.

From this point on, all the errors apply to the specific sector you are
looking for.  If a read passed all the previous checks, then we are at
the sector being searched for.

Note that the entire sector is read before these errors are detected.
Therefore the data, checksum and off bytes are available.

Code : $04 Error : 22 Type : Read Message : Data descriptor byte not
found (HEX $07, GCR $55)

Each sector data block is preceeded by the value $07, the "data block"
descriptor.  If this value is not there, this error is generated.  Each
encoded sector has actually 260 bytes.  First is the descriptor byte,
then follows the 256 bytes of data, a checksum, and two "off" bytes.

Code : $05 Error : 23 Type : Read Message : Checksum error in data block

The checksum of the data read of the disk is calculated, and compared
against the one stored at the end of the sector.  If there's a
discrepancy, this error is generated.

Code : $0F Error : 74 Type : Read Message : Drive Not Ready (no disk in
drive or no device 1)

These errors only apply when writing to a disk.  I don't see the
usefulness of having these as they cannot be present when only *reading*
a disk.

Code : $06 Error : 24 Type : Write Message : Write verify (on format)

Code : $07 Error : 25 Type : Write Message : Write verify error

Once the GCR-encoded sector is written out, the drive waits for the
sector to come around again and verifies the whole 325-byte GCR block.
Any errors encountered will generate this error.

Code : $08 Error : 26 Type : Write Message : Write protect on

Self explanatory.  Remove the write-protect tab, and try again.

Code : $0A Error : 28 Type : Write Message : Write error

In actual fact, this error never occurs, but it is included for
completeness.

This is not an error at all, but it gets reported when the read of a
sector is ok.

Code : $01 Error : 00 Type : N/A Message : No error.

Self explanatory.  No errors were detected in the reading and decoding
of the sector.

The advantage with using the 35 track D64 format, regardless of error
bytes, is that it can be converted directly back to a 1541 disk by
either using the proper cable and software on the PC, or send it down to
the C64 and writing it back to a 1541.  It is the best documented format
since it is also native to the C64, with many books explaining the disk
layout and the internals of the 1541.

16.5 The X64 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

This file type, created by Teemu Rantanen, is used on the X64 emulator
(a UNIX-based emulator) which has been superceeded by VICE. Both VICE
and X64 support the X64 file standard, with VICE also supporting the
regular D64 and T64 files.

X64 is not a specific type of file, but rather encompasses *all* known
C64 disk types (hard disk, floppies, etc).  An X64 is created by
prepending a 64-byte header to an existing image (1541, 1571, etc) and
setting specific bytes which describe what type of image follows.  This
header has undergone some revision, and this description is based on the
1.02 version, which was the last known at the time of writing.

The most common X64 file you will see is the D64 variety, typically
174912 bytes long (174848 for the D64 and 64 bytes for the header,
assuming no error bytes are appended).  The header layout (as used in
64COPY) is as follows:

00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
-----------------------------------------------
0000: 43 15 41 64 01 02 01 23 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0010: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0020: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0030: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
0040: XX XX XX <- standard C64 image starts here....

Bytes          Description
$00-$03        This is the "Magic header" ($43 $15 $41 $64)
$04            Header version major ($01)
$05            Header version minor ($01, now its up to $02)
$06            Device type represented
$07            Maximum tracks in image (only in version 1.02 or
greater) 1540/41/70: 35 1571: 35 1581: 80 (Logical
single-sided disk)
$08            Number of disk sides in image.  This value must be $00
for all 1541 and 1581 formats.  $00=No second side
$01=Second side
$09            Error data flag.
$0A-$1F        Unused, set to $00
$20-$3E        Disk image description (in ASCII or ISO Latin/1)
$3F            Always set to $00
$40-           Standard C64 file begins here.

The device types are:

Value          Drive type
$00            1540 See note below...
$01            1541 (Default)
$02            1542
$03            1551
$04            1570
$05            1571
$06            1572
$08            1581
$10            2031 or 4031
$11            2040 or 3040
$12            2041
$18            4040
$20            8050
$21            8060
$22            8061
$30            SFD-1001
$31            8250
$32            8280

The first four bytes used for the device type at position $06 ($00 to
$03) are functionally the same, and are compatible with older version of
X64 files.  Some old X64 files might have $00 for the device type
(instead of $01), but it makes no real difference.

As most instances of X64 files will be strictly 1541 images, bytes
$08-$3F are set to zero, and some versions of the X64 emulator don't use
bytes $08-$3F.

16.6 The D71 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

Similar to the D64 (1541), the 1571 drive can operate in either
single-sided (1541 compatible) mode or double-sided (1571) mode.  In
this section I will be dealing with the double-sided mode only.  For the
breakdown of the single-sided mode, see the D64 section.

The D71 has 70 tracks, double that of the 1541, with a DOS file size of
349696 bytes.  If the error byte block (1366 bytes) is attached, this
makes the file size 351062 bytes.  The track range and offsets into the
D71 files are as follows:

Track                                Sec/trk            # Sectors
1-17 (side 0)                        21                 357
18-24 (side 0)                       19                 133
25-30 (side 0)                       18                 108
31-35 (side 0)                       17                 85
36-52 (side 1)                       21                 357
53-59 (side 1)                       19                 133
60-65 (side 1)                       18                 108
66-70 (side 1)                       17                 85

The directory structure is the same as a D64/1541.  All the same
filetypes apply, the directory still only holds 144 files per disk and
should only exist on track 18.

The first two bytes of the sector ($12/$04 or 18/4) indicate the
location of the next track/sector of the directory.  If the track value
is set to $00, then it is the last sector of the directory.  It is
possible, however unlikely, that the directory may *not* be competely on
track 18 (some disks do exist like this).  Just follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00.  The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter.  The drive will return
all the available entries anyways.  This is a breakdown of a standard
directory sector and entry:

This is a breakdown of a standard directory entry:

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00/$FF
if its the last sector)
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file
$05-$14        16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first side-sector block (REL
file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only, max.  value 254)
$18-$1D        Unused (except with GEOS disks)
$1E-$1F        File size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E+$1F*256).
The approx.  filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE-@ replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ
0010           2              PRG
0011           3              USR
0100           4              REL

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange results.
The 1571 is inconsistent in how it treats these bits.  Some routines use
all 4 bits, others ignore bit 3, resulting in values from 0-7.

When the 1571 is in is native ("1571") mode, files are stored with a
sector interleave of 6, rather than 10 which the 1541 (and the 1571 in
"1541" mode) uses.  The directory still uses an interleave of 3.

16.6.1 Non-Standard & Long Directories
--------------------------------------

Most Commodore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory track
where all filenames are stored.  This limits the number of files stored
on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.  There
are some disk images that contain more files than would normally be
allowed.  This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there.  The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive.  However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non- extended part.  Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is on
and assume the default directory track for operations.

To explain: assume that the directory has been extended from track 18 to
track 19/6 and that the directory is full except for a few slots on
19/6.  When saving a new file, the drive DOS will find an empty file
slot at 19/6 offset $40 and correctly write the filename and a few other
things into this slot.  When the file is done being saved the final file
information will be written to 18/6 offset $40 instead of 19/6 causing
some directory corruption to the entry at 18/6.  Also, the BAM entries
for the sectors occupied by the new file will not be saved and the new
file will be left as a SPLAT (*) file.

Attempts to validate the disk will result in those files residing off
the directory track to not be allocated in the BAM, and could also send
the drive into an endless loop.  The default directory track is assumed
for all sector reads when validating so if the directory goes to 19/6,
then the validate code will read 18/6 instead.  If 18/6 is part of the
normal directory chain then the validate routine will loop endlessly.

16.6.2 Bam layout
-----------------

The BAM is somewhat different as it now has to take 35 new tracks into
account.  In order to do this, most of the extra BAM information is
stored on track 53/0, and the remaining sectors on track 53 are marked
in the BAM as allocated.  This does mean that except for one allocated
sector on track 53, the rest of the track is unused and wasted.  (Track
53 is the equivalent to track 18, but on the flip side of the disk).
Here is a dump of the first BAM sector...

$DD-$FF                              Free sector count for tracks 36-70
(1 byte/track).

The "free sector" entries for tracks 36-70 are likely included here in
the first BAM sector due to some memory restrictions in the 1571 drive.
There is only enough memory available for one BAM sector, but in order
to generate the "blocks free" value at the end of a directory listing,
the drive needs to know the extra track "free sector" values.  It does
make working with the BAM a little more difficult, though.

These are the values that would normally be with the 4-byte BAM entry,
but the rest of the entry is contained on 53/0.

Note: If the DOS version byte is set to anything other than $41 or $00,
then we have what is called "soft write protection".  Any attempt to
write to the disk will return the "DOS Version" error code 73.  The 1571
is simply telling you that it thinks the disk format version is
incorrect.

The BAM entries require some explanation.  Take the first entry at bytes
$04-$07 ($12 $FF $F9 $17).  The first byte ($12) is the number of free
sectors on that track.  Since we are looking at the track 1 entry, this
means it has 18 (decimal) free sectors.

The next three bytes represent the bitmap of which sectors are
used/free.  Since it is 3 bytes (8 bits/byte) we have 24 bits of
storage.  Remember that at most, each track only has 21 sectors, so
there are a few unused bits.  These entries must be viewed in binary to
make any sense.  We will use the first entry (track 1) at bytes 04-07:

FF=11111111, F9=11111001, 17=00010111

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222
01234567 89012345 67890123
--------------------------
11111111 10011111 11101000
^                     ^
sector 0           sector 20

Since we are on the first track, we have 21 sectors, and only use up to
the bit 20 position.  If a bit is on (1), the sector is free.
Therefore, track 1 has sectors 9,10 and 19 used, all the rest are free.

In order to complete the BAM, we must check 53/0.

Each track from 36-70 has 3 byte entries, starting at address $00.

Byte: $00-$02: $FF $FF $1F - BAM map for track 36
$03-$05: $FF $FF $1F - BAM map for track 37
...
$33-$35: $00 $00 $00 - BAM map for track 53
...
$66-$68: $FF $FF $01 - BAM map for track 70
$69-$FF:             - Not used

You can break down the entries for tracks 36-70 the same way as track 1,
just combine the free sector bytes from 18/0 and the BAM usage from 53
to get the full 4-byte entry.

Just like a D64, you can attach error bytes to the file, for sector
error information.  This block is 1366 bytes long, 1 byte for each of
the 1366 sectors in the image.  With the error bytes, the file size is
351062 bytes.

16.7 The D81 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

Like D64 and D71, this is a byte for byte copy of a physical 1581 disk.
It consists of 80 tracks, 40 sectors each (0 to 39) for a size of 819200
bytes, or 3200 sectors.  If the error byte block is attached, this makes
the file size 822400 bytes.

There are three sectors on the directory track used for disk internals
(header and BAM), leaving 37 sectors for filename entries, thus allowing
for 296 files (37 * 8) to be stored at the root level of the disk.

The actual physical layout on the disk is quite different from what the
user sees, but this is unimportant to the scope of this section.  One
important difference from the D64 and D71 is all the sector interleaves
are now 1 for both files and directory storage (rather than 3 for
directory and 10 for file on a D64/D71).  This is due to the built-in
buffering in the 1581.  When reading a sector, the whole track will be
buffered in memory, and any sectors being modified will be done in
memory.  Once it has to be written, the whole track will be written out
in one step.

The track range and offsets into the D81 files are as follows:

Track              #Sect              #SectorsIn         D81 Offset
1                  40                 0                  $00000
2                  40                 40                 $02800

The header sector is stored at 40/0, and contains the disk name, ID and
DOS version bytes, but the BAM is no longer contained here (like the
D64).

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of the first directory sector
(should be set to 40/3 but it doesn't matter, and don't
trust what is there, always go to 40/3 for first
directory entry)
$02            Disk DOS version type (see note below) $44 ('D')=1581
$03            $00
$04-$13        16 character Disk Name (padded with $A0)
$14-$15        $A0
$16-$17        Disk ID
$18            $A0
$19            DOS Version ("3")
$1A            Disk version ("D")
$1B-$1C        $A0
$1D-$FF        Unused (usually $00)

The following might be set if the disk is a GEOS format (this info is
based on the D64 layout, and might not prove to be true)

Bytes          Description
$AB-$AC        Border sector (GEOS only, else set to $00)
$AD-$BC        GEOS ID string ("geos FORMAT V1.x" GEOS only, else $00)
$BD-$FF        Unused (usually $00)

Note: If the DOS version byte is changed to anything other than a $44
(or $00), then we have what is called "soft write protection".  Any
attempt to write to the disk will return the "DOS Version" error code
73.  The drive is simply telling you that it thinks the disk format
version is incompatible.

The directory track should be contained totally on track 40.  Sectors
3-39 contain the entries and sector 1 and 2 contain the BAM (Block
Availability Map).  Sector 0 holds the disk name and ID. The first
directory sector is always 40/3, even though the t/s pointer at 40/0
(first two bytes) might point somewhere else.  It goes linearly up the
sector count, 3-4-5-6-etc.  Each sector holds up to eight entries.

The first two bytes of the sector ($28/$04) indicate the location of the
next track/sector of the directory (40/4).  If the track is set to $00,
then it is the last sector of the directory.  It is possible, however
unlikely, that the directory may *not* be competely on track 40.  Just
follow the chain anyhow.

When the directory is done (track=$00), the sector should contain an
$FF, meaning the whole sector is allocated.  Theactual value doesn't
matter as all the entries will be returned anyways.  Each directory
sector has the following layout:

$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file or
partition

$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first SUPER SIDE SECTOR block
(REL file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only)
$18-$1B        Unused (except with GEOS disks)
$1C-$1D        (Used during an SAVE or OPEN, holds the new t/s link)
$1E-$1F        File or partition size in sectors, low/high byte order
($1E+$1F*256).  The approx.  file size in bytes is <=
#sectors * 254

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE-@ replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ

0101           5              CBM (partition or sub-directory)

Values 6-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange results.

16.7.1 Non-Standard & Long Directories
--------------------------------------

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory track
where all filenames are stored.  This limits the number of files stored
on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.  There
are some disk images that contain more files than would normally be
allowed.  This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there.  The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive.  However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part.  Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is on
and assume the default directory track for operations.

16.7.2 BAM layout
-----------------

The BAM is located on 40/1 (for side 0, tracks 1-40) and 40/2 (for side
1, tracks 41-80).  Each entry takes up six bytes, one for the "free
sector" count and five for the allocation bitmap.

...
$BE-$C3: BAM entry for track 30 (track 70, side 1)
...
$FA-$FF: BAM entry for track 40 (track 80, side 1)

The BAM entries require some explanation, so lets look at the track 40
entry at bytes $FA-FF ($24 $F0 $FF $2D $FF $FE). The first byte ($24, or
36 decimal) is the number of free sectors on that track.  The next five
bytes represent the bitmap of which sectors are used/free.  Since it is
five bytes (8 bits/byte) we have 40 bits of storage.  Since this format
has 40 sectors/track, the whole five bytes are used.

F0: .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. 24 F0 FF 2D FF FE

The last five bytes of any BAM entry must be viewed in binary to make
any sense.  We will once again use track 40 as our reference:

F0=11110000, FF=11111111, 2D=00101101, FF=11111111, FE=11111110

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222 22222233 33333333
Sector 01234567 89012345 67890123 45678901 23456789
-------------------------- -------- --------
00001111 11111111 10110100 11111111 01111111

Note that if a bit is on (1), the sector is free.  Therefore, track 40
has sectors 0-3, 17, 20, 22, 23 and 32 used, all the rest are free.

The second BAM (for side 1) contains the entries for tracks 41-80.

It is laid out exactly as the side 0 BAM except for one difference.  The
track/sector reference for the next sector should be set to $00/$FF,
indicating there is no next sector.

16.7.3 REL files
----------------

The REL filetype requires some extra explaining.  It was designed to
make access to data *anywhere* on the disk very fast.  Take a look at
this directory entry...

00: 00 FF 84 27 00 41 44 44 49 54 49 4F 4E 41 4C 20
10: 49 4E 46 4F A0 27 02 FE 00 00 00 00 00 00 D2 0B

The third byte ($84) indicates this entry is a REL file and that the
three normally empty entries at offset $15, $16 and $17 are now used as
they are explained above.  It's the track/sector chain that this entry
points to, called the SUPER SIDE SECTOR, which is of interest here (in
this case, 39/2).  The SUPER SIDE SECTOR is very different from the D64
format.  If you check the D64 entry for a REL file and do the
calculations, you will find that the maximum file size of the REL file
is 720 data sectors.  With the new SUPER SIDE SECTOR, you can now have
126 groups of these SIDE SECTORS chains, allowing for file sizes up to
(theoretically) 90720 sectors, or about 22.15 Megabytes.

Here is a dump of the beginning of the SUPER SIDE SECTOR...

00: 27 01 FE 27 01 15 09 03 0F 38 16 4A 1C 00 00 00
10: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
20: 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

Bytes:
$00-$01: Track/sector of first side sector in group 0
$02: Always $FE
$03-$04: Track/sector of first side sector in group 0 (again)
...
$FD-$FE: Track/sector of first side sector in group 125
$FF: Unused (likely $00)

The side sector layout is the same as the D64/1571.

Bytes:
$00: Track location of next side-sector ($00 if last sector)
$01: Sector location of next side-sector
$02: Side-sector block number (first sector is $00, the next is
$01, then $02, etc)
$03: REL file RECORD size (from directory entry)
$04-$0F: Track/sector locations of the six other side-sectors. Note
the first entry is this very sector we have listed here.
The next is the next t/s listed at the beginning of the
sector. All of this information must be correct. If one of
these chains is $00/$00, then we have no more side sectors.
Also, all of these (up to six) side sectors must have the
same values in this range.
$10-$FF: T/S chains of *each* sector of the data portion. When we
get a $00/$00, we are at the end of the file.

16.7.4 1581 Partitions and Sub-directories
------------------------------------------

At the beginning of this section it was stated that the 1581 can hold
296 entries "at the root level".  The 1581 also has the ability to
partition areas of the disk.  Under the right conditions these can
become sub-directories, acting as a small diskette, complete with its
own directory and BAM. When you are inside of a sub-directory, no other
files except those in that directory are visible, or can be affected.

To the 1581, this file will show up as a "CBM" filetype in a directory.
All this does is tell the disk that a file, starting at X/Y track/sector
and Z sectors large exists.  Doing a validate will not harm these files
as they have a directory entry, and are fully allocated in the BAM.

There are two main uses for partitions.  One is to simply allocate a
section of the disk to be used for direct-access reads/writes, and lock
it away from being overwritten after a VALIDATE. The second is as a
sub-directory, basically a small "disk within a disk".

In order to use a partition as a sub-directory, it must adhere to the
following four rules:

1. If must start on sector 0
2. It's size must be in multiples of 40 sectors
3. It must be a minimum of 120 sectors long (3 tracks)
4. If must not start on or cross track 40, which limits the
biggest directory to 1600 sectors (tracks 1-39).

This is a dump of a sub-directory entry:

00: 00 FF 85 29 00 50 41 52 54 49 54 49 4F 4E 20 31
10: A0 A0 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 40 06

It is a partition starting on track 41/0, extends for 1600 sectors, and
has been formatted as a sub-directory.  Note that when a partition is
created, the area being allocated is not touched in any way.  If you
want it set up as a sub-directory, you must issue the FORMAT command to
the 1581 to create the central directory and BAM. Also note that from
the directory entry you can't tell whether it is a sub-directory or not,
just that it fits the sub-directory parameters.

The BAM track for the sub-directory exists on the first track of the
partition, and has the same layout as the disk BAM on track 40.  The
biggest difference is the "disk name" is what what given when the
partition was formatted rather than what the actual disk name is.  Also,
except for the free sectors in the partition area, all other sectors in
the BAM will be allocated.

If the partition size doesn't match the above rules for a sub-directory,
it will simply exist as a "protected" area of the disk, and can't be
used as a sub-directory.  Either way, it still shows up as a "CBM" type
in a directory listing.  Below is a dump of a 10-sector partition
starting on track 5/1, which does not qualify as a sub-directory...

00: 00 00 85 05 01 53 4D 41 4C 4C 50 41 52 54 20 32
10: A0 A0 A0 A0 A0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0A 00

The master BAM shows the entry for this partition on track 5...

00: 28 02 44 BB 43 44 C0 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
10: 23 C1 FF FF FF FF 28 FF FF FF FF FF 28 FF FF FF
20: FF FF 28 FF FF FF FF FF 1E 01 F8 FF FF FF 28 FF
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The breakdown of the BAM shows the allocation for this track, with
sectors 1-10 allocated, as it should be.

10000000 00011111 11111111 11111111 11111111
^          ^          ^         ^          ^
0          10         20        30         39

Partitions and sub-directories share one very important trait.  When
created, the sub-directory entry simply has the starting track/sector
and the size of the partition in sectors.  Partitions are created
linearly, meaning if one starts on 30/1 and is of size 15 sectors, then
the sector range from 1 through 15 on track 30 will be allocated.  If a
partition size crosses a track boundary, the allocation will continue on
the next track starting on sector 0, and going up.

The section allocated will *not* have a track/sector chain like a file
would, but rather is dependant on the directory entry to keep it from
being overwritten.  You can store whatever you want to in the allocated
area.

16.7.5 AUTO-BOOT LOADER
-----------------------

If byte $07 in the BAM is set, then when the drive is reset (and other
circumstances) it will look for a USR file called "COPYRIGHT CBM 86".
This file will then be loaded into the drive RAM and executed.

The format for this auto-loader file is fairly basic.  It starts with a
two-byte load address, a size byte, program data, and a checksum at the
end.

Bytes:
$00-$01: Load address, low/high format
$02: Size of program (SZ) (smaller than 256 bytes)
$03-($03+SZ-1): Program data
$03+SZ: Checksum byte

16.8 The D80 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

This is a sector-for-sector copy of an 8050 floppy disk.  The file size
for an 8050 image is 533248 bytes.  It is comprised of 256-byte sectors
arranged across 77 tracks, with a varying number of sectors per track
for a total of 2083 sectors.  Track counting starts at 1 (not 0) and
sector counting starts at 0 (not 1), therefore a track with 29 sectors
will go from 0 to 28.

The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in circles,
with track 1 on the very outside of the disk (closest to the sides) to
track 77 being on the inside of the disk (closest to the inner hub
ring).  Commodore, in their infinite wisdom, varied the number of
sectors per track and data densities across the disk to optimize
available storage, resulting in the chart below.  It shows the
sectors/track for a D80.  Since the outside diameter of a circle is the
largest (versus closer to the center), the outside tracks have the
largest amount of storage.

Track Range              Sectors/track            # Sectors

The BAM (Block Availability Map) is on track 38.  The D80 is only 77
tracks and so the BAM is contained on 38/0 and 38/3.  The BAM interleave
is 3.

The directory is on track 39, with 39/0 contains the header (DOS type,
disk name, disk ID's) and sectors 1-28 contain the directory entries.
Both files and the directory use an interleave of 1.  Since the
directory is only 28 sectors large (29 less one for the header), and
each sector can contain only 8 entries (32 bytes per entry), the maximum
number of directory entries is 28 * 8 = 224.  The first directory sector
is always 39/1.  It then follows a chain structure using a sector
interleave of 1 making the links go 39/1, 39/2, 39/3 etc.

When reading a disk, you start with 39/0 (disk label/ID) which points to
38/0 (BAM0), 38/3 (BAM1), and finally to 39/1 (first dir entry sector).
When writing a file to a blank disk, it will start at 38/1 because 38/0
is already allocated.

Below is a dump of the header sector 39/0:

The first two bytes of the directory sector ($27/$02) indicate the
location of the next track/sector of the directory (39/2).  If the track
is set to $00, then it is the last sector of the directory.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00.  The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter.  The drive will return
all the available entries anyways.  This is a breakdown of a standard
directory sector:

Bytes          Description
$00-$1F        First directory entry
$20-$3F        Second dir entry
$40-$5F        Third dir entry
$60-$7F        Fourth dir entry
$80-$9F        Fifth dir entry
$A0-$BF        Sixth dir entry
$C0-$DF        Seventh dir entry
$E0-$FF        Eighth dir entry

This is a breakdown of a standard directory entry:

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00 $00
if not the first entry in the sector)
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file
$05-$14        16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first side-sector block (REL
file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only, max.  value 254)
$18-$1D        Unused
$1E-$1F        File size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E+$1F*256).
The approx.  filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE-@ replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ
0010           2              PRG
0011           3              USR
0100           4              REL

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange results.

16.8.1 Non-Standard & Long Directories
--------------------------------------

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory track
where all filenames are stored.  This limits the number of files stored
on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.  There
are some disk images that contain more files than would normally be
allowed.  This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there.  The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive.  However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part.  Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is on
and assume the default directory track for operations.

16.8.2 BAM layout
-----------------

The BAM only occupies up to four sectors on track 38, so the rest of the
track is empty and is available for file storage.  Below is a dump of
the first BAM block, 38/0.  A D80 will only contain two BAM sectors,
38/0 and 38/3.  Each entry takes 5 bytes, 1 for the free count on that
track, and 4 for the BAM bits.

$06-$0A                BAM for track 1.  The first byte shows the
"blocks free" for this track, the remaining 4
show the BAM for the track.
$0B-$0F                BAM for track 2
...                    ...
$FB-$FF                BAM for track 50

Being bit-based, the BAM entries need some explanation.  The first track
entry in the above BAM sector is at offset 06, "1D FF FF FF 1F". The
first number is how many blocks are free on this track ($1D=29) and the
remainder is the bit representation of the usage map for the track.
These entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense.  First convert
the values to binary:

FF=11111111, FF=11111111, FF=11111111, 1F=00011111

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222 222222
01234567 89012345 67890123 456789...
-------------------------- ---------
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000
^                              ^
sector 0                   sector 28

Since we are on the first track, we have 29 sectors, and only use up to
the bit 28 position.  If a bit is on (1), the sector is free.
Therefore, track 1 is clean, all sectors are free.  Any leftover bits
that refer to sectors that don't exist, like bits 29-31 in the above
example, are set to allocated.

Second BAM block 38/3.

16.9 The D82 disk image format
==============================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

This is a sector-for-sector copy of an 8250 floppy disk.  The file size
for an 8250 image is 1066496 bytes.  It is comprised of 256-byte sectors
arranged across 154 tracks, with a varying number of sectors per track
for a total of 4166 sectors.  Track counting starts at 1 (not 0) and
sector counting starts at 0 (not 1), therefore a track with 29 sectors
will go from 0 to 28.

The original media (a 5.25" disk) has the tracks laid out in circles,
with track 1 on the very outside of the disk (closest to the sides) to
track 77 being on the inside of the disk (closest to the inner hub
ring).  Commodore, in their infinite wisdom, varied the number of
sectors per track and data densities across the disk to optimize
available storage, resulting in the chart below.  It shows the
sectors/track for a D82.  Since the outside diameter of a circle is the
largest (versus closer to the center), the outside tracks have the
largest amount of storage.

The BAM (Block Availability Map) is on track 38.  The D82 is 154 tracks
and so the BAM is contained on 38/0, 38/3, 38/6 and 38/9.  The BAM
interleave is 3.

The directory is on track 39, with 39/0 contains the header (DOS type,
disk name, disk ID's) and sectors 1-28 contain the directory entries.
Both files and the directory use an interleave of 1.  Since the
directory is only 28 sectors large (29 less one for the header), and
each sector can contain only 8 entries (32 bytes per entry), the maximum
number of directory entries is 28 * 8 = 224.  The first directory sector
is always 39/1.  It then follows a chain structure using a sector
interleave of 1 making the links go 39/1, 39/2, 39/3 etc.

When reading a disk, you start with 39/0 (disk label/ID) which points to
38/0 (BAM0), 38/3 (BAM1), 38/6 (BAM2), 38/9 (BAM3, and finally to 39/1
(first dir entry sector).  When writing a file to a blank disk, it will
start at 38/1 because 38/0 is already allocated.

Below is a dump of the header sector 39/0:

The first two bytes of the directory sector ($27/$02) indicate the
location of the next track/sector of the directory (39/2).  If the track
is set to $00, then it is the last sector of the directory.

When the directory is done, the track value will be $00.  The sector
link should contain a value of $FF, meaning the whole sector is
allocated, but the actual value doesn't matter.  The drive will return
all the available entries anyways.  This is a breakdown of a standard
directory sector:

Bytes          Description
$00-$1F        First directory entry
$20-$3F        Second dir entry
$40-$5F        Third dir entry
$60-$7F        Fourth dir entry
$80-$9F        Fifth dir entry
$A0-$BF        Sixth dir entry
$C0-$DF        Seventh dir entry
$E0-$FF        Eighth dir entry

This is a breakdown of a standard directory entry:

Bytes          Description
$00-$01        Track/Sector location of next directory sector ($00 $00
if not the first entry in the sector)
$02            File type
$03-$04        Track/sector location of first sector of file
$05-$14        16 character filename (in PETASCII, padded with $A0)
$15-$16        Track/Sector location of first side-sector block (REL
file only)
$17            REL file record length (REL file only, max.  value 254)
$18-$1D        Unused
$1E-$1F        File size in sectors, low/high byte order ($1E+$1F*256).
The approx.  filesize in bytes is <= #sectors * 254

The file type field is used as follows:

Bits           Description
0-3            The actual file type
4              Unused
5              Used only during SAVE-@ replacement
6              Locked flag (Set produces ">" locked files)
7              Closed flag (Not set produces "*", or "splat" files)

The actual file type can be one of the following:

Binary         Decimal        File type
0000           0              DEL
0001           1              SEQ
0010           2              PRG
0011           3              USR
0100           4              REL

Values 5-15 are illegal, but if used will produce very strange results.

16.9.1 Non-Standard & Long Directories
--------------------------------------

Most Commdore floppy disk drives use a single dedicated directory track
where all filenames are stored.  This limits the number of files stored
on a disk based on the number of sectors on the directory track.  There
are some disk images that contain more files than would normally be
allowed.  This requires extending the directory off the default
directory track by changing the last directory sector pointer to a new
track, allocating the new sectors in the BAM, and manually placing (or
moving existing) file entries there.  The directory of an extended disk
can be read and the files that reside there can be loaded without
problems on a real drive.  However, this is still a very dangerous
practice as writing to the extended portion of the directory will cause
directory corruption in the non-extended part.  Many of the floppy
drives core ROM routines ignore the track value that the directory is on
and assume the default directory track for operations.

16.9.2 BAM layout
-----------------

The BAM only occupies up to four sectors on track 38, so the rest of the
track is empty and is available for file storage.  Below is a dump of
the first BAM block, 38/0.  A D82 will contain four BAM sectors, 38/0,
38/3, 38/6 and 38/9.  Each entry takes 5 bytes, 1 for the free count on
that track, and 4 for the BAM bits.

first number is how many blocks are free on this track ($1D=29) and the
remainder is the bit representation of the usage map for the track.
These entries must be viewed in binary to make any sense.  First convert
the values to binary:

FF=11111111, FF=11111111, FF=11111111, 1F=00011111

In order to make any sense from the binary notation, flip the bits
around.

111111 11112222 222222
01234567 89012345 67890123 456789...
-------------------------- ---------
11111111 11111111 11111111 11111000
^                              ^
sector 0                  sector 28

Since we are on the first track, we have 29 sectors, and only use up to
the bit 28 position.  If a bit is on (1), the sector is free.
Therefore, track 1 is clean, all sectors are free.  Any leftover bits
that refer to sectors that don't exist, like bits 29-31 in the above
example, are set to allocated.

16.10 The P00 image format
==========================

(This section was contributed by Peter Schepers and slightly edited by
Marco van den Heuvel.)

These files were created for use in the PC64 emulator, written by
Wolfgang Lorenz.  Each one has the same layout with the filetype being
stored in the DOS extension (i.e.  Pxx is a PRG, Sxx is a SEQ, Uxx is a
USR and Rxx is a RELative file), and the header is only 26 bytes long.

This is a dump of a Pxx file (PRG)...

00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 0A 0B 0C 0D 0E 0F
-----------------------------------------------
0000: 43 36 34 46 69 6C 65 00 43 52 49 53 49 53 20 4D
0010: 4F 55 4E 54 41 49 4E 00 00 00

Bytes                  Description
$00-$06                ASCII string "C64File"
$07                    Always $00
$08-$17                Filename in PETASCII, padded with $00 (not $A0,
like a D64)
$18                    Always $00
$19                    REL file record size ($00 if not a REL file)
$1A-??                 Program data

The 'xx' in the extension of the file is usually 00, except when we have
two DOS filenames which would be the same, but the C64 filenames are
different!  If we have two C64 filenames which are the same, they
*cannot* co-exist in the same directory.  If we have two files which do
convert down to be the same DOS filename, the extension is incremented
until an unused one is found (x01, x02, x03, up to x99).  We can have up
to 99 different C64 files with the same corresponding DOS names as
that's all the extension will hold (from P00 to P99).

Each PC64 file only has one entry, there are no multi-file containers
allowed.  This could result in a large number of these files in a
directory, even for only a few programs, as each C64 file will result in
a PC64 file entry.  The best use for a PC64 file is a single-file
program, one which does not load anything else.

16.11 The CRT cartridge image format
====================================

This chapter is based on CRT.txt (rev1.14) compiled by Peter Schepers,
with additional contributions from Per Hakan Sundell, Markus Brenner,
Marco Van Den Heuvel, Groepaz.

Cartridge files were introduced in the CCS64 emulator, written by Per
Hakan Sundell, and use the ".CRT" file extension.  This format was
created to handle the various ROM cartridges that exist, such as Action
Replay, the Power cartridge, and the Final Cartridge.

Normal game cartridges can load into several different memory ranges
($8000-9FFF, $A000-BFFF or $E000-FFFF). Newer utility and freezer
cartridges were less intrusive, hiding themselves until called upon, and
still others used bank-switching techniques to allow much larger ROM's
than normal.  Because of these "stealthing" and bank-switching methods,
a special cartridge format was necessary, to let the emulator know where
the cartridge should reside, the control line states to enable it and
any special hardware features it uses.

Camels"...

From the above chart, the following table can be built.  It shows
standard cartridges, either 8K or 16K in size, and the memory ranges
they load into.

Type     Size   Game   EXRom  Low Bank  High Bank
in K   Line   Line    (ROML)    (ROMH)
-------------------------------------------------
Normal    8k     hi     lo     $8000      ----
Normal    16k    lo     lo     $8000     $A000
Ultimax   8k     lo     hi     $E000      ----

The ROMH and ROML lines are CPU-controlled status lines, used to bank
in/out RAM, ROM or I/O, depending on what is needed at the time.

Ultimax cartridges typically are situated in the $E000-FFFF (8K) ROM
address range.  There are some cartridges which only use 4K of the 8K
allocation.  If the cartridge is 16K in size, then it will reside in
both $8000-9FFF and $E000-FFFF.

This cart has 32Kb of ROM, and 8Kb of RAM. The bank switching is done by
writing to the I/O-1 range as follows:

bit  meaning
---  -------
7    extra ROM bank selector (A15) (unused)
6    1 = resets FREEZE-mode (turns back to normal mode)
5    1 = enable RAM at ROML ($8000-$9FFF) &
I/O-2 ($DF00-$DFFF = $9F00-$9FFF)
4    ROM bank selector high (A14)
3    ROM bank selector low  (A13)
2    1 = disable cartridge (turn off $DE00)
1    1 = /EXROM high
0    1 = /GAME low

Additionally the RAM or ROM can be available through a window in the
I/O-2 range.

A total of 64 kB of ROM memory is organized into four $4000 banks
located at $8000-$BFFF.

The banks are arranged in the following way:

Bank 0:  BASIC, Monitor, Disk-Turbo
Bank 1:  Notepad, BASIC (Menu Bar)
Bank 2:  Desktop, Freezer/Print
Bank 3:  Freezer, Compression

The cartridges uses the entire I/O-1 and I/O-2 range.  Bank switching is
done by writing the bank number plus $40 into memory location $DFFF. For
instance, to select bank 2, $DFFF is set to $42.

The CRT file contains four CHIP blocks, each block with a start address
of $8000, length $4000 and the bank number in the bank field.  In the
cartridge header, both EXROM ($18) and GAME ($19) are set to 1 to enable
the 16 kB ROM configuration.

The registers are arranged in the following way:

One register at $DFFF:

bit  meaning
---  -------
7      Hide this register (1 = hidden)
6      NMI line  (0 = low = active) *1)
5      GAME line  (0 = low = active) *2)
4      EXROM line (0 = low = active)
2-3    unassigned (usually set to 0)
0-1    number of bank to show at $8000

1) if either the freezer button is pressed, or bit 6 is 0, then an NMI
is generated

2) if the freezer button is pressed, GAME is also forced low

The rest of I/O-1/I/O-2 contain a mirror of the last 2 pages of the
currently selected ROM bank (also at $dfff, contrary to what some other
documents say)

Simons' BASIC permanently uses 16 kB ($4000) bytes of cartridge memory
from $8000-$BFFF. However, through some custom bank-switching logic the
upper area ($A000-$BFFF) may be disabled so Simons' BASIC may use it as
additional RAM. Writing a value of $01 to address location $DE00 banks
in ROM, $00 disables ROM and enables RAM.

The CRT file contains two CHIP blocks of length $2000 each, the first
block having a start address of $8000, the second block $A000.  In the
cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set to 1 to
indicate the RESET/power-up configuration of 8 kB ROM.

The FUN PLAY Cartridge uses $DE00 for bank selection, and uses 8Kb banks
($2000) at $8000-$9FFF. There are 16 banks of ROM memory and are
referenced by the following values:

$00 -> Bank 0
$08 -> Bank 1
$10 -> Bank 2
$18 -> Bank 3
$20 -> Bank 4
$28 -> Bank 5
$30 -> Bank 6
$38 -> Bank 7
$01 -> Bank 8
$09 -> Bank 9
$11 -> Bank 10
$19 -> Bank 11
$21 -> Bank 12
$29 -> Bank 13
$31 -> Bank 14
$39 -> Bank 15

The bank field in the chip headers is set according to the value written
to $DE00.  The following bits are used for bank decoding in $DE00 (0
being the LSB, 3 being the MSB).

Bit# 76543210

After copying memory from the ROM banks, the selection program writes a
value of $86 to $DE00.  This seems either to reset or disable the
cartridge ROM.

The Super Games cartridge uses 4 16Kb banks ($8000-$BFFF) of ROM memory.
Bank selecting is done by writing to $DF00.

$DF00 register is as follows:

bit   meaning
---   -------
0    bank bit 0
1    bank bit 1
2    mode (0 = EXROM/GAME (bridged on the same wire - 16k config)
1 = cartridge disabled)
3    write-protect-latch  (1 = no more changes are possible until
the next hardware-reset )
4-7   unused

This cart has 32Kb of ROM and 8Kb of RAM

Writing to I/O-1 will do the following:

bit  meaning
---  -------
7    extra ROM bank selector (A15) (unused)
6    1 = resets FREEZE-mode (turns back to normal mode)
5    1 = enable RAM at ROML ($8000-$9FFF) &
I/O-2 ($DF00-$DFFF = $9F00-$9FFF)
4    ROM bank selector high (A14)
3    ROM bank selector low  (A13)
2    1 = disable cartridge (turn off $DE00)
1    1 = /EXROM high
0    1 = /GAME low

If bit 5 (RAM enable) is 1, bit 0,1 (exrom/game) is == 2 (cart off), bit
2,6,7 (cart disable, freeze clear) are 0, then cart ROM (Bank 0..3) is
mapped at 8000-9FFF, and cart RAM (Bank 0) is mapped at A000-BFFF and
cart RAM (Bank 0) is is enabled in the I/O-2 area using 16Kb game
config.

The cart RAM or ROM is available through a window in the I/O-2 range.

The Epyx FastLoad cart uses a simple capacitor to toggle the ROM on and
off:

the capacitor is discharged, and 8k game config enabled, by either
reading ROML or reading I/O-1.  If none of those accesses happen the
capacitor will charge, and if it is charged (after 512 cycles) then the
ROM will get disabled.

Here is a list of the known cartridges:

C64GS 4-in-1      (Commodore)  (512 kB)
Last Ninja Remix  (System 3)   (512 kB)
Myth              (System 3)   (512 kB)

ROM memory is organized in 8Kb ($2000) banks located at $8000-$9FFF.
Bank switching is done by writing to address $DE00+X, where X is the
bank number (STA $DE00,X). For instance, to read from bank 3, address
$DE03 is written to.  Reading from anywhere in the I/O-1 range will
disable the cart.

The CRT file contains a string of CHIP blocks, each block with a start
address of $8000, length $2000 and the bank number in the bank field.
In the cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set to 1
to enable the 8 kB ROM configuration.

After RESET or POWER ON, 16kB of cartridge ROM is visible at
$8000-$BFFF. Additionally, ROM normally located at $9E00-$9FFF is
mirrored into I/O-1 and I/O-2 at $DE00-$DFFF. ROM at $8000-$BFFF is
disabled by writing into the I/O-2 area (typically $DF00) and may be
re-enabled by writing into I/O-1 ($DE00).  However, the $DE00-$DFFF
(I/O-1/I/O-2) area itself always remains mapped to cartridge ROM.

Here is a list of the known DINAMIC cartridges:

Narco Police  (128 kB)
Satan         (128 kB)

ROM memory is organized in 8Kb ($2000) banks located at $8000-$9FFF.
Bank switching is done by reading from address $DE00+X, where X is the
bank number (LDA $DE00,X). For instance, to read from bank 3, address
$DE03 is accessed.

The CRT file contains a string of CHIP blocks, each block with a start
address of $8000, length $2000 and the bank number in the bank field.
In the cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set to 1
to enable the 8 kB ROM configuration.

The (Super) Zaxxon carts use a 4Kb ($1000) ROM at $8000-$8FFF (mirrored
in $9000-$9FFF) along with two 8Kb ($2000) cartridge banks located at
$A000-$BFFF. One of the two banks is selected by doing a read access to
either the $8000-$8FFF area (bank 0 is selected) or to $9000-$9FFF area
(bank 1 is selected).  EXROM ($18 = $00) and GAME ($19 = $00) lines are
always pulled to GND to select the 16 kB ROM configuration.

The CRT file includes three CHIP blocks:
a) bank = 0, load address = $8000, size = $1000
b) bank = 0, load address = $A000, size = $2000
c) bank = 1, load address = $A000, size = $2000

This cartridge type is very similar to the OCEAN cart type: ROM memory
is organized in 8Kb ($2000) banks located at $8000-$9FFF. Bank switching
is done by writing the bank number to $DE00.  Deviant from the Ocean
type, bit 7 is cleared for selecting one of the ROM banks.  If bit 7 is
set ($DE00 = $80), the GAME/EXROM lines are disabled, turning on RAM at
$8000-$9FFF instead of ROM.

In the cartridge header, EXROM ($18) is set to 0, GAME ($19) is set to 1
to indicate the RESET/power-up configuration of 8 kB ROM.

Here is a list of the known cartridges:

Ghosbusters        (HES Australia)   (32 kB)
Magic Desk         (Commodore)       (32 kB)

This is an eprom cartridge.  It has 1 2764 (8Kb) which holds the base
eprom with the base menu, and 2 27256 eproms of which 8Kb parts are
banked into the $8000-9FFF area.

The bank selecting is done by writing to $DE00.  The following bits are
used for bank decoding in $DE00 (0 being the LSB, 3 being the MSB).

Bit# 76543210
xx10xx32

Any bank value below 4 or above 11 switches in the base bank (bank 0).

The bit values for each eprom bank are :

This is an eprom cartridge.  It has 8 8Kb banks of which the first holds
the base menu, the other eproms can be banked into the $8000-9FFF area.

The bank selecting is done by writing to $DE00.  Each low bit is used to
bank in the respective eprom.  If all bits are high then the EXROM is
switched off.

The bit values for each eprom bank is:

eprom bank 1 : 11111110 ($FE) (base eprom)

This is an eprom cartridge.  It has 9 eprom sockets, of which the first
holds the base eprom with the base menu which is an 8Kb eprom, the other
eprom sockets can handle 8Kb, 16Kb or 32Kb eproms, of which 8kb can be
banked into the $8000-9FFF area.

The bank selecting is done by writing to $DFA0.  Bits 2, 1 and 0
determine which socket is used and bits 5 and 4 are used to select an
8Kb piece of the eprom.

The possible values for bits 5 and 4 for the (extra) eprom banks are:

8Kb        : 3, 2, 1, 0

16Kb bank 0 : 2, 0
16Kb bank 1 : 3, 1

32Kb bank 0 : 0
32Kb bank 1 : 1
32Kb bank 2 : 2
32Kb bank 3 : 3

Reading from $DFC0 switches off the EXROM. Reading from $DFE0 switches
on the EXROM.

This cart has 32Kb of ROM, bank 0 is in the cart image but is unused.
The first 8Kb of the cart image is unused, the second 8Kb of the cart
image is mapped to $E000-$FFFF, the third 8Kb of the cart image is
mapped to $8000-$9FFF and the fourth 8Kb of the cart image is mapped to
$A000-$BFFF. An NMI can be triggered by the cart, if address $0001 is
written to and the cartridge is enabled.  The cart can be disabled by
software, by clearing bit 4 when writing to $DF00-$DFFF. Cart ROM at
$E000-$FFFF can be disabled by setting bit 5 to 0 when writing to
$DF00-$DFFF. Cart ROM at $8000-$BFFF can be disabled by setting bit 6 to
1 when writing to $DF00-$DFFF. Bit 7 of a byte written to $DF00-$DFFF
can be read back from the cartridge if enabled (like a memory cell).

This cart has 16Kb of ROM, of which the first 8Kb is mapped in at
$8000-$9FFF and the second 8Kb is used as a kernel replacement.  The
kernel replacement is achieved by a clip that needs to be installed
inside the C64.

Reading from I/O-1 causes a capacitor to get charged with every read,
once the capacitor is charged enough it switches the cart on.

Reading from I/O-2 causes a different capacitor to get charged with
every read, once the capacitor is charged enough it switched the cart
off.

EasyFlash is a 1 MByte Flash EPROM card with multiple configurations and
banks possible, it also has 256 bytes of RAM which is mapped into the
I/O-2 range.

There are two control registers, one at $DE00 and one at $DE02.

The register at $DE00 does the following:

bit  meaning
---  -------
7    LED control
6-3  Unused
2    Mode (0/1)
1    Exrom line control
0    Game line control

The register at $DE02 controls which bank is mapped into ROMH and ROML.

This cart has 8Kb of ROM which is mapped to $E000, and 8Kb of RAM which
is mapped to $6000.  The cartridge is disabled after a reset.

When the freeze button is pressed the following happens:

* an NMI is generated
* as soon as the current adress is in bank 0xfe the cart switches to
ultimax mode.  The cart ROM then contains one page full of "jmp
$eaea", which ultimately calls the freezer code.
* the $FFF7/$FFF8 "register" logic is enabled and any access (read or
write) to $FFF7 will turn the cart_enabled off (leave ultimax
mode), and an access to $FFF8 will turn the cart back on (enter
ultimax mode).  the "register logic" that causes this can only be
disabled again by a hardware reset.

The Retro Replay has three registers: Two write-only ($DE00 & $DE01) and
one read-only register ($DE00 & $DE01 giving the same results).

The register at $DE00 is reset to $00 on a hard reset if not in flash
mode.  If in flash mode, it is set to $02 in order to prevent the
computer from starting the normal cartridge.  Flash mode is selected
with a jumper.

Register at $DE00:

bit  meaning
---  -------
0    Controls the GAME line: A 1 asserts the line, a 0  will  deassert
it.
1    Controls the EXROM line: A 0 will assert it, a  1  will  deassert
it.
2    Writing a 1 will disable further write accesses to all  registers
of the Retro Replay, and  set  the  memory  map  of  the  C64  to
standard, as if there is no cartridge installed at all.
3    Controls bank-address 13 for ROM and RAM banking.
4    Controls bank-address 14 for ROM and RAM banking.
5    Switches between ROM and RAM: 0=ROM, 1=RAM
6    Must be written once to "1" after a successful freeze in order to
set the correct memory map and  enable  bits  0  and  1  of  this
register. Otherwise no effect.
7    Controls bank-address 15 for ROM banking.

The register at $DE01 is the extended control register.  If not in Flash
mode, bits 1, 2 and 6 can only be written once.  If in Flash mode, the
REUcomp bit cannot be set, but the register will not be disabled by the
first write.  Bit 5 is always set to 0 if not in Flash mode.

Register at $DE01:

bit  meaning
---  -------
0    Enable clockport connector.
1    AllowBank (1 allows banking of RAM in $DF00/$DE02 area)
2    NoFreeze (1 disables Freeze function)
3    Bank-address 13 for RAM and ROM (mirror of $DE00)
4    Bank-address 14 for RAM and ROM (mirror of $DE00)
5    Bank-address 16 for ROM (only in flash mode)
6    REU compatibility bit. 0=standard memory map, 1 = REU  compatible
memory map
7    Bank-address 15 for ROM (mirror of $DE00)

Reading from the registers at either $DE00 or $DE01 will return the
content of the status register.

Status register:

bit  meaning
---  -------
0    1=Flashmode active (jumper set)
1    feedback of AllowBank bit
2    1=Freeze button pressed
3    feedback of banking bit 13
4    feedback of banking bit 14
5    feedback of banking bit 16
6    1=REU compatible memory map active
7    feedback of banking bit 15

The following memory maps are available:

* standard - $DE00 and $DE01 registers are active, $DF00-$DFFF
contain the last page of the selected 8Kb bank of either ROM or
RAM, whatever is selected.  RAM can only be accessed in
$8000-$9FFF. ROM can be mapped to $8000, $A000 or $E000 with the
corresponding status on GAME and EXROM.

Note: If the AllowBank bit is not set, the $DF00-$DFFF area will
always access bank 0 of the RAM, so the older cartridge images will
work.  The AllowBank bit does not have any effect on the ROM mirror
in that area.

* Freeze - ROM is mapped to $E000-$FFFF, bank 0 is active directly
after Freeze.  Writing to bits 0 and 1 of the $DE00 register will
have no effect on GAME and EXROM. RAM can be selected and used in
$DF00 or $DE02, respectively, but not in $8000.  Banking bits work,
so you have full read access to the ROM, and access to up to four
RAM pages with the AllowBank bit set (minus 2 bytes if REU
compatible bit is set).  You should leave this memory map ASAP by
setting bit 6 of $DE00, because C64 RAM in the $E000 area is not
available, and you don't have control of the GAME and EXROM lines.

* REU compatible - $DE00 and $DE01 registers are active, $DE02-$DEFF
contain a mirror of $9E02-$9EFF of the selected 8K-bank of either
ROM or RAM, whatever is selected.  RAM can only be accessed in
$8000-$9FFF. ROM can be mapped to $8000, $A000 or $E000 with the
corresponding status on GAME and EXROM. The $DF00 stays free for
use with the 1764 Ram Expansion Unit (REU).

Note: If the AllowBank bit is not set, the $DE02-$DEFF area will
always access bank 0 of the RAM, so the older cartridge images will
work.  The AllowBank bit does not have any effect on the ROM mirror
in that area.

0    0 = disable clock port, 1 = enable clockport

The registers at $DE02-$DE0F / $DF22-$DF2F are for the clock port and
are read/write.

The register at $DF10 is the MMC64 SPI transfer register, a byte written
to this registers is sent to the card & response from the card is read
here.

The register at $DF11 is the MMC64 control register:

bit  meaning
---  -------
0    0 = MMC64 BIOS active, 1 = external ROM active
1    0 = card selected, 1 = card not selected
2    0 = 250khz transfer, 1 = 8mhz transfer
3    0 = clock port @ $DE00, 1 = clock port @ $DF20

1 = disable external ROM
6    0 = SPI write trigger mode, 1 = SPI read trigger mode
7    0 = MMC64 is active, 1 = MMC64 is completely disabled (**)

(*) bit can only be programmed when flash jumper is set (**) bit can
only be modified after unlocking

The register at $DF12 is the MMC64 status register, which is read-only:

bit  meaning
---  -------
0    0 = SPI ready, 1 = SPI busy
1    external GAME line
2    external EXROM line
3    0 = card inserted, 1 = no card inserted
4    0 = card write enabled, 1 = card write disabled
5    0 = flash jumper not set, 1 = flash jumper set
6-7  unused

The register at $DF13 is the MMC64 identification register, which when
reading from it can have the following values:

$64 when bit 1 of $DF11 is 0.  $01 when bit 1 of $DF11 is 1 and REV A
hardware is used.  $02 when bit 1 of $DF11 is 1 and REV B hardware is
used.

when writing to it it can be used to unlock bit 7 of $DF11 or to
re-enable the cart:

ROM config register at $DF00 (can only be written to):

bit  meaning
---  -------
0    ?
1    ? (write 1 to release freeze mode)
2    ROM bank select
3    write 1 to disable cartridge
4-6  unused
7    ?

Note: if bit0, bit1, bit7 are all 0, then ultimax mapping is selected
and RAM is enabled at ROML, otherwise if bit 0 is 0, then 16Kb mapping
is enabled, or if bit 0 is 1, then 8Kb mapping is enabled.

RAM config register at $DF01 (read/write):

If written value == last value - 1, then ultimax mapping is selected and
RAM is enabled at ROML, if written value == last value + 1, then ROM is
enabled at ROML and exrom is deasserted (switch to either 8k or 16k
mapping)

$DF02-$DFFF holds the last page of the first 8kb of the current bank.

When the cartridge is active, ultimax is enabled when the address being
accessed is is the $E000-$FFFF range, so the ROM is visible at $E000,
below is normal C64 RAM. The cart can be disabled by writing to either
I/O-1 or I/O-2 range.  When the freezer button is pressed, the cartridge
will be enabled and an NMI will be triggered.

This cart has 16Kb of ROM, mapped in at reset at $8000-$BFFF. The cart
is controled through a TPI at $DF80-$DF87:

$DF80 - Port A Data
$DF81 - Port B Data
$DF82 - Port C Data
$DF83 - Port A Direction
$DF84 - Port B Direction
$DF85 - Port C Direction
$DF86 - Control register
$DF87 - Active Interrupt register

The cart has a pass-through port and does the following at start-up:

* Program starts after reset at $FFD3, and copies code from
$FF36-$FFD2 to $0200-$029C (157 bytes)

* Program continues at $021A, copies $A000-$BFFF from EPROM to RAM at
$A000-$BFFF (8Kb), copies $E000-$FFFF from EPROM to RAM at
$E000-$FFFF (8Kb), copies $AE62-$B461 from RAM to RAM at
$C000-$C5FF (Magic Voice Code)

* Jump to beginning of Magic Voice code at $C000

Accessing I/O-1 (the software uses $DE00 only it seems) disables
cartridge ROM. A reset enables 8K game mode and the ROM bank is mapped
to $8000.  A freeze causes ROM to be mapped to $8000.

This cart has 64Kb ROM (2 32Kb Eproms, mapped to $8000 and $A000 in 16Kb
Game Mode), and 32Kb RAM (mapped to $8000 and $A000 in 16K Game Mode).
The cart has 1 (write-only) bank control register which is located at
$DE80 and mirrored throughout the $DE80-$DEFF range:

Bit 0: unused/don't care
Bit 1: Bank select: 0=upper, 1=lower (not correct ?!)
Bit 2: chip select 0
Bit 3: chip select 1
Bit 4: cartridge enable/disable: 0=enable, 1=disable
Bits 5-7: unused/don't care

Chip select combinations of 0/1 are:
00: Eprom "79"
01: Eprom "ZS3"
10: Ram
11: empty space (reading returns VIC-II data)

note: on the original hardware "disabling" the cartridge by setting bit
4 of the control register does NOT prevent write accesses to the
cartridge RAM!. So to actually disable the RAM, it is suggested to write
$FF to the register.

This cart has 24Kb ROM (3 8Kb Eproms)

reading io1:
- switches to 16k game mode
- first eprom mapped to 8000 (ROML)
- second eprom mapped to A000 (ROMH)

writing io1:
- switches to ultimax mode _only_:
- if 0xc000 > address >= 0x8000
- if address >= 0xe000
(meaning 0x0000-0x7fff and 0xc000-0xdfff gives normal c64 ram/io)
- first eprom mapped to 8000 (ROML)
- third eprom mapped to e000 (ROMH)

Cartridge hardware is designed around a 128Kb ROM (PROM or Mask ROM)
which is divided into 16 banks each of 8Kb.  When adressing the onboard
bank-switching logic the requested ROM bank is mapped at address range
$8000-$9fff (8Kb)

The cartridge PCB layout was cost-optimized for mass-production
purposes.

The address-/data-lines and bank-switching logic uses the closest
address-/data-lines with shortest and most direct path/distance in order
to avoid too much PCB re-routing and keep production costs as low as
possible.

This means that the respective address-/data-lines from the cartridge
port may not necessarily connect with the corresponding
address-/data-line of the ROM according to the official specs of the
ROM.

This has over the years given some headaches and invalid dumps when
cartridge dumpers that wanted to dump the cartridge contents by
de-soldering the ROM and dumping it using an EPROM programmer/reader.

The image extracted from such an operation would need transformation
according to the actual cartridge PCB re-routing of address-/data-lines.
Alternatively one can make an adapter that implements this applied
re-routing of the address-/data-lines.

This mass-production cost optimization also results in an obscured
bank-switching address pattern/values more info on that later.

[HWrev1]: The original "Hugo" PCB [HWrev1] is labeled "HUGO Copyright
1990" on both sides of the PCB. PCB production date is stamped on the
back og PCB in the format: "YYMM" 1Mbit 27C010 EPROM or PROM (typical
Atmel) "Hugo" PCB [HWrev1] contains the following discrete logic IC
components: 74LS00N (DIP) and 74LS237N (DIP) DIP pitch (pin spacing)
2.54mm (0.1 inch) Assembly/production facilities: Philips, Strandlodsvej
(Amager), Copenhagen, Denmark

[HWrev1] Bank-switching pattern: In order for the rom contents to appear
as a continuous memory layout the following ROM bank-switching pattern
must be applied by writing to adress 0xDE00: Cartridge bank-switching
values: 00 80 10 90 20 a0 30 b0 40 c0 50 d0 60 e0 70 f0 Writing the
bank-switch value to any address in address-range 0xDE00-0xDEFF will
work.

[HWrev2]: Revised PCB [HWrev2] for SMD mount is labeled "SO-A4-1" on
both sides of PCB. 1Mbit Mask ROM (SOIC-32) PCB contains the following
discrete logic SMD IC components: 74HCT02T (SOIC-14) and 74HCT174T
(SOIC-16) SOIC (pitch) pin spacing 1.27mm (SMD mounted)
Assembly/production facilities: Sono Press, Germany.

[HWrev2] Uses alternative bank-switching pattern: Writing *ANY* value to
address 0xDE0y (offset y) will select ROM bank y Cartridge still has 16
banks and the lower four bits in the address selects the right bank.
Hence the valid address range is 0xDE00-0xDE0F

the following is a quick overview of how the cartridge works, as its a
bit unusual and different from most other cartridges:

- 27256 EPROM (32k)
- 7430 TTL
- MC6821
- 1 button (reset)

rom bank 0x00 - 0x03 (0x04) 8192* 4 32k mapped to e000
MC6821 registers mapped to io2 at dfc0..dfc4

- press reset and hold delete to get the main menu
- press reset and hold control to skip cbm80 check
(dont start additional cartridge)

- press RESTORE, then...
- left arrow, return  show disk directory
- delete, 1           load"*" from disk, run
- f1/f2               ? (disk stuff?)
- f3/f4               ? (disk stuff?)
- f5/f6, q            enter monitor
- f7/f8, 2            show drive error channel
- control, cursor     back to basic

- type "help" in basic to get a list of available commands

*** MC6821 Port usage

Port A (parallel cable to floppy drive):
dfc0 port a ddr
dfc1 port a (in/out)

Port B (controls banking)
dfc2 port b ddr ($7f)
dfc3 port b (out)

bit3    1 = rom at $e000 enabled, 0 = cartridge disabled

16.12 The PSID image format for ripped SID tunes
================================================

This section describes the SID file format used for SID tunes in the
HVSC (High Voltage SID Collection - http://hvsc.de).  It is based mostly
on Michael Schwendt's document that describes the file format and the
PSID v2NG extensions described by Simon White and Dag Lem and was
further extended by Wilfred Bos (PSID v3/v4, RSID v3/v4) and LaLa
(assembled most of the following text) and last not least tweaked a bit
by Groepaz to fit into the VICE documentation.

The original documentation maintained by the HVSC team can be found
here:
<http://www.hvsc.de/download/C64Music/DOCUMENTS/SID_file_format.txt>

SID files use the .sid file extension.

Since PSID v2 is simply an extension of PSID v1, PSID v2NG is an
extension of PSID v2, RSID is a restricted version of PSID v2NG, PSID
v3/v4 and RSID v3/v4 are extentions of PSID v2NG and RSID v2, all of the
formats are discussed together below.  RSID in specific is discussed in
detail under the 'magicID' field description.

The information presented here targets programmers or other people with
reasonable background.  It is not suitable for newbies who have never
before used a machine code monitor, a disassembler, or a hexadecimal
editor.

16.12.1 The SID file header v1
------------------------------

The detailed structure of the SID header looks like the following.
Header offsets are in hexadecimal notation.  Other integer values are
decimal unless explicitly marked otherwise.  Any stored integer values
are in big-endian format:

+00    magicID: ``PSID'' or ``RSID''

This is a four byte long ASCII character string containing the value
0x50534944 or 0x52534944.  'RSID' (Real SID) denotes that the file
strictly requires a true Commodore-64 environment to run properly.
'PSID' files will generally run trouble-free on older PlaySID and
libsidplay1 based emulators, too.

Some words about the Real C64 SID file format (RSID):

The RSID format was designed to contain tunes that are not PlaySID
compatible, but strictly require a real C64 environment to run.  Tunes
that are multi-speed and/or contain samples and/or use additional
interrupt sources or do busy looping will cause older SID emulators to
lock up or play very wrongly (if at all).

By using the name RSID for such rips all existing SID emulators will
reject these tunes safely until they can be upgraded to cope with the
additional requirements.

Due to the nature of these tunes, every effort must be made to make sure
they are directly runnable on an actual C64 computer.  As such the tunes
will only be presented with the default C64 power-on environment and
expected to configure and use all hardware appropriately.

RSID is based on PSIDv2NG with the following modifications:

* magicID = RSID
* version = 2, 3 and 4 only
* loadAddress = 0 (reserved)
* playAddress = 0 (reserved)
* speed = 0 (reserved)
* psidSpecific flag is called C64BASIC flag

The above fields MUST be checked and if any differ from the above then
the tune MUST be rejected.  The definitions above will force tunes to
contain proper hardware configuration code and install valid interrupt
handlers.

See section "The SID file environment" below for the default C64
power-on environment for each SID file format.

+04    WORD version

Available version number can be 0001, 0002, 0003 or 0004.  Headers of
version 2, 3 and 4 provide additional fields.  RSID and PSID v2NG files
must have 0002, 0003 or 0004 here.

+06    WORD dataOffset

This is the offset from the start of the file to the C64 binary data
area.  Because of the fixed size of the header, this is either 0x0076
for version 1 and 0x007C for version 2, 3 and 4.

+08    WORD loadAddress

The C64 memory location where to put the C64 data.  0 means the data are
in original C64 binary file format, i.e.  the first two bytes of the
data contain the little-endian load address (low byte, high byte).  This
must always be true for RSID files.  Furthermore, the actual load
address must NOT be less than $07E8 in RSID files.

You must be absolutely sure what to enter here.  There is no way to
detect automatically whether the first two bytes in a C64 data file are
meant to be a load address or some arbitrary bytes of code or data.
Unless your C64 file is not a normal binary file and thus has no load
address in front, you need not enter anything else than 0 here.  The SID
tune will not play if you specify a load address which is present in the
C64 file already.

Normal C64 binary data files have a load address in their first two
bytes, so they can be loaded to a pre-defined destination address by
executing LOAD"FILE",8,1, for instance.  If a load address is explicitly
specified in the sidtune info file, some sidtune converters and
utilities conjecture that the C64 data don't have a load address in
their first two bytes.  Hence, the explicit load address from the info
file is moved in front of the C64 data to create a valid C64 binary file
which can be easily loaded on a C64, too.  If that C64 file were to be
saved, it would contain two superfluous data bytes at offset 2 if an
original load address had been in the first two bytes of the old file.
This process of adding a duplicate load address can be repeated.  The
file loader strips off the first two bytes (the used load address) and
puts the rest of the file contents (including the now obsolete load
address at file offset 2) into memory.  If the new load address is the
same than the old one the two added bytes cause the whole data to be
displaced by two bytes, which most likely results in malfunctioning
code.  Also, superfluous bytes in memory then can confuse disassemblers
which start at the beginning of the file or memory buffer.

+0A    WORD initAddress

The start address of the machine code subroutine that initializes a
song, accepting the contents of the 8-bit 6510 Accumulator as the song
number parameter.  0 means the address is equal to the effective load
address.

In RSID files initAddress must never point to a ROM area ($A000-$BFFF or
$D000-$FFFF) or be lower than $07E8.  Also, if the C64 BASIC flag is
set, initAddress must be 0.

+0C    WORD playAddress

The start address of the machine code subroutine that can be called
frequently to produce a continuous sound.  0 means the initialization
subroutine is expected to install an interrupt handler, which then calls
the music player at some place.  This must always be true for RSID
files.

+0E    WORD songs

The number of songs (or sound effects) that can be initialized by
calling the init address.  The minimum is 1.  The maximum is 256.

+10    WORD startSong

The song number to be played by default.  This value is optional.  It
often specifies the first song you would hear upon starting the program
is has been taken from.  It has a default of 1.

+12    LONGWORD speed

This is a 32 bit big endian number.

For version 1 and 2 and for version 2NG, 3 and 4 with PlaySID specific
flag (+76) set, the 'speed' should be handled as follows:

Each bit in 'speed' specifies the speed for the corresponding tune
number, i.e.  bit 0 specifies the speed for tune 1.  If there are more
than 32 tunes, the speed specified for tune 32 is the same as tune 1,
for tune 33 it is the same as tune 2, etc.

For version 2NG, 3 and 4 with PlaySID specific flag (+76) cleared, the
'speed' should be handled as follows:

Each bit in 'speed' specifies the speed for the corresponding tune
number, i.e.  bit 0 specifies the speed for tune 1.  If there are more
than 32 tunes, the speed specified for tune 32 is also used for all
higher numbered tunes.

For all version counts:

* A 0 bit specifies vertical blank interrupt (50Hz PAL, 60Hz NTSC),
and a 1 bit specifies CIA 1 timer interrupt (default 60Hz).
* Surplus bits in 'speed' should be set to 0.
* For RSID files 'speed' must always be set to 0.

Note that if 'play' = 0, the bits in 'speed' should still be set for
backwards compatibility with older SID players.  New SID players running
in a C64 environment will ignore the speed bits in this case.

WARNING: This field does not work in PlaySID for Amiga like it was
intended, therefore the above is a redefinition of the original 'speed'
field in SID v2NG! See also the 'clock' (video standard) field described
below for 'flags'.

+16    ``<name>''
+36    ``<author>''
+56    ``<released>'' (once known as ``<copyright>'')

These are 32 byte long ASCII character strings.  Upon evaluating the
header, these fields may hold a character string of 32 bytes which is
not zero terminated.  For less than 32 characters the string should be
zero terminated.  The maximum number of available free characters is 32.

+76    <data>

Version 1 of the SID header is complete at this point.  The binary C64
data starts here.

16.12.2 The SID file header v2, v3 and v4
-----------------------------------------

Version 2, 3 and 4 of the header incorporates the v1 header fields and
provides additional fields.  Some of these are actually v2NG, v3 or v4
specific - those are noted below.

+76    WORD flags

This is a 16 bit big endian number containing the following bitfields:

* Bit 0 specifies format of the binary data (musPlayer): 0 = built-in
music player, 1 = Compute!'s Sidplayer MUS data, music player must
be merged.

If this bit is set, the appended binary data are in Compute!'s Sidplayer
MUS format, and does not contain a built-in music player.  An external
player machine code must be merged to replay such a sidtune.

* Bit 1 specifies whether the tune is PlaySID specific, e.g.  uses
PlaySID samples (psidSpecific): 0 = C64 compatible, 1 = PlaySID
specific (PSID v2NG, v3, v4) 1 = C64 BASIC flag (RSID)

This is a v2NG and RSID specific field.

PlaySID samples were invented to facilitate playback of C64 volume
register samples with the original Amiga PlaySID software.  PlaySID
samples made samples a reality on slow Amiga hardware with a player that
was updated only once a frame.

Unfortunately, converting C64 volume samples to PlaySID samples means
that they can no longer be played on a C64, and furthermore the
conversion might potentially break the non-sample part of a tune if the
timing between writes to the SID registers is at all altered.  This
follows from the ADSR bugs in the SID chip.

Today, the speed of common hardware and the sophistication of the SID
players is such that there is little need for PlaySID samples.  However,
with all the PlaySID sample PSIDs in existence there's a need to
differentiate between SID files containing only original C64 code and
PSID files containing PlaySID samples or having other PlaySID specific
issues.  As stated above, bit 1 in 'flags' is reserved for this purpose.

Since RSID files do not have the need for PlaySID samples, this flag is
used for a different purpose: tunes that include a BASIC executable
portion will be played (with the BASIC portion executed) if the C64
BASIC flag is set.  At the same time, initAddress must be 0.

* Bits 2-3 specify the video standard (clock): 00 = Unknown, 01 =
PAL, 10 = NTSC, 11 = PAL and NTSC.

This is a v2NG specific field.

As can be seen from the 'speed' field, it is not possible to specify
NTSC C64 playback.  This is unfortunate, since the different clock
speeds means that a tune written for the NTSC C64 will be slightly
detuned if played back on a PAL C64.  Furthermore, NTSC C64 tunes driven
by a vertical blank interrupt have to be converted to use the CIA 1
timer to fit into this scheme.  This can cause severe problems, as the
NTSC refresh rate is once every 17045 cycles, while the CIA 1 timer A is
latched with 17095 cycles.  Apart from the difference in timing itself,
the SID ADSR bugs can actually break the tune.

The 'clock' (video standard) field was introduced to circumvent this
problem.

* Bits 4-5 specify the SID version (sidModel): 00 = Unknown, 01 =
MOS6581, 10 = MOS8580, 11 = MOS6581 and MOS8580.

This is a v2NG specific field.

* Bits 6-7 specify the SID version (sidModel) of the second SID: 00 =
Unknown, 01 = MOS6581, 10 = MOS8580, 11 = MOS6581 and MOS8580.

If bits 6-7 are set to Unknown then the second SID will be set to the
same SID model as the first SID.

This is a v3 specific field.

* Bits 8-9 specify the SID version (sidModel) of the third SID: 00 =
Unknown, 01 = MOS6581, 10 = MOS8580, 11 = MOS6581 and MOS8580.

If bits 8-9 are set to Unknown then the third SID will be set to the
same SID model as the first SID.

This is a v4 specific field.

The MOS6581 and the MOS8580 have three notable differences.  First,
combined waveforms are generally louder on a MOS8580, to the extent that
some combinations that are clearly audible on a MOS8580 are completely
silent on a MOS6581.  Second, the internal DC levels in the MOS8580 are
so small that software or hardware tricks must be used to play volume
samples.  Third, the MOS8580 analog filter has totally different
characteristics from the MOS6581 analog filter.

To ensure that music specifically written for one of the two SID
versions can be played back correctly, bits 4-9 in 'flags' are used as
stated above.

* Bits 10-15 are reserved and should be set to 0.

+78    BYTE startPage (relocStartPage)

This is a v2NG specific field.

This is an 8 bit number.  If 'startPage' is 0, the SID file is clean,
i.e.  it does not write outside its data range within the driver ranges.
In this case the largest free memory range can be determined from the
start address and the data length of the SID binary data.  If
'startPage' is 0xFF, there is not even a single free page, and driver
relocation is impossible.  Otherwise, 'startPage' specifies the start
page of the single largest free memory range within the driver ranges.
For example, if 'startPage' is 0x1E, this free memory range starts at
$1E00.

+79    BYTE pageLength (relocPages)

This is a v2NG specific field.

This is an 8 bit number indicating the number of free pages after
'startPage'.  If 'startPage' is not 0 or 0xFF, 'pageLength' is set to
the number of free pages starting at 'startPage'.  If 'startPage' is 0
or 0xFF, 'pageLength' must be set to 0.

The relocation range indicated by 'startPage' and 'pageLength' should
never overlap or encompass the load range of the C64 data.  For RSID
files, the relocation range should also not overlap or encompass any of
the ROM areas ($A000-$BFFF and $D000-$FFFF) or the reserved memory area
($0000-$03FF).

+7A    BYTE secondSIDAddress

This is a v3 specific field.  For v2NG, it should be set to 0.

This is an 8 bit number indicating the address of the second SID. It
specifies the middle part of the address, $Dxx0, starting from value $42
for $D420 to $FE for $DFE0).  Only even values are valid.  Ranges
$00-$41 ($D000-$D410) and $80-$DF ($D800-$DDF0) are invalid.  Any
invalid value means that no second SID is used, like $00.

+7B    BYTE thirdSIDAddress

This is a v4 specific field.  For v2NG and v3, it should be set to 0.

This is an 8 bit number indicating the address of the third SID. It
specifies the middle part of the address, $Dxx0, starting from value $42
for $D420 to $FE for $DFE0).  Only even values are valid.  Ranges
$00-$41 ($D000-$D410) and $80-$DF ($D800-$DDF0) are invalid.  Any
invalid value means that no third SID is used, like $00.  The address of
the third SID cannot be the same as the second SID.

+7C    <data>

Version 2, 3 and 4 of the SID header ends here.  This offset is the
start of the binary C64 data.  See also 'loadAddress' for what the first
2 bytes of 'data' might indicate.

16.12.3 The SID file environment
--------------------------------

Before the data of a SID file is loaded in memory of a C64, certain
addresses and chips must be initialized in order to play the SID tune
correctly.

For RSID and PSID files the following address must be set:

$02A6                  depending on the PAL/NTSC flag in the SID file
header, it is set to 0x01 for PAL and set to
0x00 for NTSC.

The default C64 environment for PSID files is as follows:

VIC                    IRQ set to any raster value less than 0x100.
Enabled when speed flag is 0, otherwise
disabled.
CIA 1 timer A          set to 60Hz (0x4025 for PAL and 0x4295 for NTSC)
with the counter running.  IRQs active when
speed flag is 1, otherwise IRQs are disabled.
Other timers           disabled and loaded with 0xFFFF.

When the init and play addresses are called the bank register value must
be written for every call and the value is calculated as follows:

if   address < $A000  -> 0x37 // I/O, Kernal-ROM, Basic-ROM
else address < $D000  -> 0x36 // I/O, Kernal-ROM
else address >= $E000 -> 0x35 // I/O only
else                  -> 0x34 // RAM only

The default C64 environment for RSID files is as follows:

VIC                    IRQ set to raster 0x137, but not enabled.
CIA 1 timer A          set to 60Hz (0x4025 for PAL and 0x4295 for NTSC)
with the counter running and IRQs active.
Other timers           disabled and loaded with 0xFFFF.
Bank register          0x37

* A side effect of the bank register is that init MUST NOT be located
under a ROM/IO memory area (addresses $A000-$BFFF and $D000-$FFFF)
or outside the load image.

* Since every effort needs to be made to run the tune on a real C64
the load address of the image MUST NOT be set lower than $07E8.

* If the C64 BASIC flag is set, the value at $030C must be set with
the song number to be played (0x00 for song 1).

19 Contact information
**********************

19.1 VICE home page
===================

You can find the latest news about VICE at the official VICE home page:

<http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net>

VICE has moved its source repository to public services provided by
SourceForge.  You can find it at
<http://sf.net/projects/vice-emu>.

We would like to thank the SourceForge staff for that help.

If you are going to report a bug, please check those pages _first_; it
is possible that the problem you encountered has already been fixed with
a newer version.

19.2 How to send feedback
=========================

Before contacting us, have a look at this manual and see if your
question is answered there.  Keep in mind that we work on VICE in our
spare-time, so the more time we don't need to answer the same questions
over and over again, the more time we have to improve the emulation
itself.  On the other hand, that does not mean that you should not
contact us, especially if you find bugs or have suggestions which might
improve the emulation.

Bug reports, suggestions, support requests should be directed to the
SourceForge trackers at

* <http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=223021>.

This way, you, the users, and we, the developers, can track what has
been reported and what has been already fixed.  Ideally, also sent the
report to the mailing address of the Vice team at

* VICE Mailing List (<vice-emu-mail@lists.sourceforge.net>) for all
general questions, bug reports, suggestions.

You can also contact (some of) us on IRC, at #vice-dev on freenode.

It's always nice to receive feedback and/or bugreports about VICE, but
please read these few notes before sending mail to anybody in the team.

* Please put the word 'VICE' _in all capitals_ in your subject line
(e.g., 'VICE fails to run game XXX').  This helps mail splitting
and reduces chances that your message is unintentionally deleted,
forgotten or lost.

* Please don't send any HTML mail (we really hate that!).  If you use
M$ Outlook or Netscape Communicator, make sure you turn off the
"rich text" (HTML) feature.

* Please don't send _any_ binaries without asking first.

* Please read the following documents carefully before reporting a
bug or a problem you cannot solve:

* the VICE documentation (you are reading it!);
* the VICE FAQ (it is available on the Internet, and reachable
from the VICE home page: <http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net>);
* the 'comp.emulators.cbm' and 'comp.sys.cbm' FAQs (*note FAQs
you should read::).

* When you report a bug, please try to be as accurate as possible and
describe how it can be reproduced to the very detail.  You should
also tell us what machine you are running on, what operating system
you are using as well as the version of it.

* Please don't ask us how to transfer original C64 disk or tapes to
your PC; this has been asked a gazillion times through email.  To
transfer disks, you can use the Star Commander
(<http://sta.c64.org/sc.html>) on DOS, and OpenCBM
(<http://www.trikaliotis.net/opencbm>) on Windows and Linux.  And
no, you cannot read C64 disks with your old 5"1/4 PC drive.

* Please don't ask us where to find games for the emulator on the
Internet.

* Please don't ask us when the next version will be out, because we
really don't know.

* Please write in English.

In any case, we would be _really_ glad to receive your comments about
VICE. We cannot always answer all the email, but we surely read all of
it.

Thanks!

19.3 How to contribute
======================

If you want to make a major contribution, please _ask_ first.  It has
already happened a couple of times that somebody started working at
something that had already been done but not released to the public yet,
and we really do _not_ want anybody to waste time.

If you are going to make a patch, please make sure the patch is relative
to the very latest version, and provide us with the following:

* Make sure you are giving us a diff against the latest Subversion
trunk version of VICE. For instructions on accessing the Subversion
repository, first read
<http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=223021> and get it with the
command:
'svn co https://vice-emu.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/vice-emu/trunk vice-src'
* send a unified diff file against the trunk version of VICE (see
above bullet point) by using the command: 'svn diff' inside of the
SVN workspace you checked out before.

* If you cannot use SVN for one or the other reason, send a unified
diff file containing all the changes you have made 'diff -u';
please don't use plain 'diff'), as it adds much work for us to get
it working;
* GNU-style 'ChangeLog' entries with a description of the changes you
have made (look at the 'ChangeLog's provided with the original VICE
sources for an example).

This is very important, and makes adding patches much smoother and
safer.

People willing to port VICE to other platforms are always welcome.  But
notice from experience it will take at least a full year of continuous
work to write a well working and stable port.

19.4 Interesting newsgroups
===========================

There are some Usenet newsgroups you might be interested in:

* 'comp.emulators.cbm', discussing about emulators of Commodore 8-bit
machines (definitely not Amiga emulators).

* 'comp.sys.cbm', discussing various topics regarding real Commodore
8-bit machines.  This newsgroup is mainly for people who actually
use original Commodore equipment (so please don't talk about
emulation here).

* 'comp.emulators.misc', discussing emulators in general.

19.5 FAQs you should read
=========================

We recommend reading the 'comp.emulators.cbm' and 'comp.sys.cbm' FAQs,
which are posted regularly on the corresponding newsgroups and are also
available via FTP from <ftp://rtfm.mit.edu>.
